wallstreetbets,Can Newly Released NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software Save NVIDIA's Stock?,1jed83g,Antonia45Heath,2025-03-18 15:16:09,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jed83g/can_newly_released_nvidia_dynamo_open_source/,"First we need to know what the NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software is for.



The above description comprehensively summarizes the main functions and application scenarios of NVIDIA Dynamo, as well as the revolutionary impact it may have on AI inference and its long-term positive effect on the company’s stock price. Specifically:



Software Functions and Application Scenarios



Intelligent Scheduling and Resource Allocation: Dynamo not only inherits the advantages of the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server but also goes further by dynamically allocating GPU resources to cope with fluctuating inference request volumes, ensuring that each GPU operates at high efficiency even under heavy load.

Optimizing Large Language Model Inference: It adopts a decomposed service strategy, distributing the processing and generation stages of large language models across multiple GPUs, which significantly improves throughput in practical applications. For example, when running the DeepSeek-R1 model on certain rack clusters, the number of tokens generated per GPU can be increased by approximately 30 times.

Multi-Framework Support and Expanded Use Cases: As an open-source software, Dynamo can support various frameworks including PyTorch and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, making it suitable for cloud service providers, data centers, and enterprise AI factories.

Revolutionary Significance



Innovation in Resource Utilization: By leveraging intelligent routing and dynamic allocation, Dynamo can double performance and revenue with the same hardware resources, fundamentally changing traditional inference deployment methods.

Building an Open-Source Ecosystem: Its open-source nature not only promotes standardization and innovation in distributed inference architectures but also fosters collaborative progress across the entire AI industry.

Enhancing Cost Efficiency and Performance: By reducing data transmission and storage costs as well as increasing GPU computational density, the software is expected to make AI services more efficient and cost-competitive.

Potential Impact on NVIDIA’s Stock Price In the long term, Dynamo is expected to help consolidate NVIDIA’s leadership in AI infrastructure, especially as the data center and cloud services segments continue to expand, thereby driving higher revenue and profit growth for the company. Although the market might remain cautious about the immediate results of the new product launch in the short term, the widespread adoption of this technology by more service providers is anticipated to have a positive effect on the stock price.



Why do I think NVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Inference Software will have a positive impact on NVDA's stock price?

Because this software will substantially boost NVIDIA's revenue in data center and cloud services.



From the public earnings data and market expectations, NVIDIA's data center and cloud services business has shown an upward trend in recent years, but it should be noted that the proportion here is subject to quarterly fluctuations, especially in quarters driven by AI demand (e.g., in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, data center revenue once accounted for 90.5%)

[CN.INVESTING.COM](http://CN.INVESTING.COM)

), while the full-year average is much smoother. Estimates based on current public information and analysis:



FY2023: Data center and cloud services business will account for approximately 43% of total annual revenue.

FY2024: The market expects this to rise to around 50% or so, driven by continued strong AI demand.

FY2025: While some quarters (e.g. Q4) are particularly strong, on average for the year, the share of data center and cloud services is expected to stabilize between 50% and 55%.

Then I started losing in trades, buying more SPY calls etc and whenever I was wrong I doubled down which caused me to lose 3-4x more than my gains.

I kept on adding more money but it never worked and by the end of Feb I was down 10k… 

I had my final 15k left and I made an “educated” gamble on how SPY would react to some upcoming news and when the news dropped I was up from 15->20k within 2 minutes. I figured fuck it let me just hold until 25k but the market immediately corrected and I lost everything. 

So here I am down ~30k from my peak and down 25k of my money that I worked two years to save up in college for.

Hello my highly regarded denizens, and let me introduce you to the upcoming insanity that will be surrounding the release of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the bowels of hell, government bureaucracy, and the OTC. I’m going to lead off with a few basic ways to play this, what kind of red flags I’ll be looking for, and some background and context in case you’re not familiar with this HIGHLY unusual situation.

First off, there are two securities you can buy here. The first are the common stock: FNMA and FMCC, for each of the companies. You need to think of these as call options with no theta and delta 1. I’m personally weighted heavily towards these since Inauguration but I’ll get more into that momentarily. Then there are the junior preferred shares, each of which correspond to one of the companies and usually share the first few letters: FNMAS, FNMAT, FNMAJ for Fannie, and FMCCH, FMCKJ, and FMCCO for Freddie. 

In case you’ve been living under a rock or are an active subscriber of The Motley Fool, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the two most profitable companies by employee, and have the largest assets on the face of fucking planet. That’s seven and a half TRILLION dollars in assets. They buy up mortgages from banks, dump ‘em together in a various pots called securitizations, and basically print money from the payments. Back in 08, the government made a determination based on secret filings that Fannie and Freddie were super dangerous, and would have to print their earnings directly into the Treasury department instead. At the head of this conservatorship, and controlling Fannie and Freddie is the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Currently, the US Treasury Department owns a million shares of the Senior Preferred Shares (SPS) at a value of around $200 billion. They ALSO own warrants, equal to diluting the common stock by 80%. The Treasury awarded themselves these shares and warrants after forcing Fannie and Freddie to take a loan out on hypothetical losses in 08, and there’s only three men who can do anything about that. Thankfully, they have a raging boner of hatred for the government.

Junior Preferred Shares (JPS) and commons are both available to common investors, but only through the OTC, so Robinhooders are in shambles (again). JPS are more protected but have capped upside; they have a par value (aka a cap in price) of either $25 or $50, and if dividends get turned on again (only after a release, covered below), they get up to 8% of par first, and then commons get the rest. There’s also a fun added bonus round just to make things more complex: JPS and Freddie commons (but not FNMA) will be getting damages awarded after the presiding judge decided to sign off (after waiting TWO years, and yes, you read that right). FMCKJ will be getting something like $3 in damages, and as of 3/17, was trading at $10. 

Then there’s common shares. High risk, ultra high reward. Depending on what kind of scenario plays out, we could see share price hitting anything from sub $2 if you believe somnambulant lawyers, to $34 if you believe Bill Ackman, to price targets that you wouldn’t fucking believe until I lay it all.

Right now, here’s the main events:

Relist: Currently commons and JPS languish in OTC purgatory. 20% pops and drops on zero news, zero halts, and lower liquidity than your mother in her memory care unit. Shambles. Rather than an IPO, the companies can follow a much simpler uplisting procedure to the NYSE This will allow institutions to buy who are restricted from OTC trading, as well as making positions marginable, including OPTIONS. Theoretically, they can uplist at any moment.
Recap: based on arbitrary regulations, Fannie and Freddie have to have some certain amount of money to backstop the loans they guarantee. How much you ask? It entirely depends on who’s in charge? Back when Mark Calabria was running things, they needed like 4.5% of their book as a reserve! Good thing that those capital requirements didn’t stop payments from running straight out of Fannie and Freddie’s wallet into untraceable Treasury accounts! The specific phrase you need to parsing Twitter headlines is “ECRF”, which stands for “Everybody Chill, Release Fannie,” letting you know that if the amount is 1.5%, Fannie will be released within a year (it’s just under the capital threshold). If it’s lower than 1.5%, Fannie can be released IMMEDIATELY. Freddie is a little slower, but he works just as hard you guys, and he won’t be far too far behind. 
Release: dividends get turned back on, justice is restored, and angelic choirs announce the golden age of America.

So let me give a couple of the RED FLAGS for free. If you see these, FLEE commons. 
Warrant Exercise. We know you’ve been trying hard to forget that reminder about your license being suspended, but this is definitely one warrant you can’t escape. Diluting the float by 80% would absolutely murder commons with no real hope of reprieve. Your only saving grace might be that OTC tends to trade headlines a day or two slow. 
SPS conversion. Just like a regular conversion, this one will also have you on your knees begging for mercy. Basically another form of dilution.
“Need for continued study.” You know how when you had that hot band chick over to study, and you kept trying to touch her hand while going over AP Calc homework, but she got angry that you weren’t paying enough attention to what SHE thought was important? This is like that. Without significant internal pressure, government impetus will stop any relist/recap/release movement simply out of being the fact that they’re collectively lazy and stupid. Given that midterms are going to be a distraction for decision makers only 15 months from now, progress needs to be made, and quickly, before GOP control of all three branches is threatened. Specifically, while some of these comments were made by Scott Bessent (now Treasury Secretary) and Bill Pulte (now FHFA Director), that was before they were confirmed, and based on everything I’m seeing, were statements to basically placate the committees. To get released, these companies will need specific and meaningful policy decisions.

Here’s what I’m IMAGINING for green flags. Seriously, there hasn’t been a lot of public statements made about these companies, but I think for good reasons, mainly political.
SPS CANCELLED. There’s several good reasons to believe the Treasury’s stock will just straight go to zero. First, the Treasury has been MORE than paid back on the loans they gave going back to 08; altogether, they got paid $340 billion over a $200 billion loan. This raises serious questions about why the government can simply continue to demand money from organizations it ‘conserves,’ which was one reason why a jury voted 8-0 to give damages in the Fairholme case. The continued existence of SPS brings into question the very notion of property rights in America.
Warrants to be sold. There’s a lot of speculation about what the Treasury would do with the warrants after a recap/relist. A popular theory is that the Treasury could gradually sell these assets off, and allocate the money to whatever pet project. This seems pretty likely, given talk about a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and similar procedures with confiscated bitcoins etc. There’s some interesting dynamics where warrants could be sold to fund a SWF, which funds real estate development, which pumps FnF, raising warrant values higher, etc.
Warrants to be CANCELLED. The ultimate bull case. If this happens, commons will launch to Mars and legends will be made. Some say the “government” would never go for this. I say the government is run by the same man who brought us TRUMPCOIN on Inauguration weekend, and we can’t even know if he has a position since filings on OTC are VOLUNTARY. Sure would be quite an ARTFUL DEAL if the decision maker about FHFA actions just so happened to have a position.

So where are we at with this?
Trump: a man with significant real estate holdings and a desire to eliminate government agencies wholesale.
Bessent: confirmed Treasury Secretary with a desire to privatize everything in sight.
Pulte: confirmed FHFA director, who on the first day, declared himself Chairman of the Board for FnF and cleared house on the board. 
At this point I’m basically just waiting for an announcement. It will probably come from Bessent who will declare something about having made an agreement with Pulte to wind down FHFA, but I wouldn’t put it past Trump to announce an executive order just ending it, a la USAID. There hasn’t been much specifically said, but there is a forest of legal red tape surrounding this thing. While there could be progress made on the legal front (final motion in Fairholme damages was finally dismissed after waiting two years, and the case still isn’t even certified!), this is ultimately a political question and it seems like all the stars have aligned. 

Positions: I've been selling JPS to capture some more volatility out of commons, I plan to rotate around a bit. 

""But you're already up a lot"" dipshit, tell me if it makes any sense for a $3 dividend to trade at $6. 

""You just want exit liquidity"" you just want to be able to breathe through your nose, but that doesn't stop you from buying BABA with less volume on the NYSE than EITHER Fannie or Freddie on the OTC.

Q4 cash flow USD $72 million, EBITDA $0.35 per share. With growth to continue through this year as an expansion ramps up in Q2. Gold has also risen an additional $250/oz since.

$72 million x4= $288mil cash flow. Convert to CAD is $412mil. KNT.TO currently has a $2.7 billion market cap. It’s trading at a mere 6x cash flow. This isn’t factoring future production at a now higher gold price, this would add an additional $15mil/quarter cash flow.

I think now that earnings are released and as market processes them KNT will go on a run all week to $13-14 range. IV has dropped and option premiums are dirt cheap. As I write this you can buy ITM $11 calls for $.45, only $0.08 premium. A run to $13 will 4x your money.

More or less an earnings play but I'm not sure if the drop will be before, on or after earnings.

ETA: some additional context at the bottom of the post that address legitimate questions that I think I can answer from comments

ETA: Updated my position to reflect adding another put option. To me on this day (3/17/2025) the market seems like it wants to keep trading back up to test 5737, maybe as high as 5809, before we see the next leg down. So I will add more as we approach those levels.

\-------------------------------------

I could write a separate post about why I think we are about to experience a black swan event (or really a black swan period) and I'm not sure if this particular point I am going to discuss will cause it. Either way there is a ton of money to be made on LMT in the next few hours / days / weeks or months.

Hard to know exactly when the market will realize just how much POTUS has fucked up LMT's business and then from there I don't know if the market will immediately see the contagion risk for other US defense companies. It may take some time for this to sink in, not sure.

Ok so about LMT - Lockheed Martin is a defense contractor. The big thing to know for this is that they make the most expensive and capable fighter aircraft (war plane for shooting down other planes and/or dropping bombs) in the world. There are huge reliability and quality issues but end of the day nothing for sale by any company on the planet can beat it and nations across the globe (Canada, UK, Germany, many other nations across Europe, etc.) have placed orders ranging from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions for F35 aircraft and after acquisition support and maintenance. The purchase price is roughly **$125,000,000** each (I'm not sure if that includes maintenance and support, I think maybe just support but there would be additional significant amounts of money going to LMT for maintenance over time).

With hundreds of billions of dollars of orders on the books, many more statements of intent from nations like Portugal, Turkiye, etc. and the associated revenue streams from maintenance, ammunition, etc. LMT has been looking pretty great since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine which sent nations across the globe scrambling to buy the bets military tech they could afford.

But that brings us to today. Where things are suddenly changing drastically and in ways that are likely not reversible, at least not in any reasonable timeframe. The market hasn't yet priced this in and I don't know exactly when that will happen. Could be during the April earnings release. Could be tomorrow when trading begins. Could be anytime between now and then.

See the thing is; when you are a nation that has managed to pull together a couple of billion dollars to buy military aircraft that you intend to use for the next 20, 30 maybe even 40 years, you tend to really think through the decision. There are many factors involved; not the least of which is how reliant are you on the manufacturer (and the nation that manufacturer is based in) for support and maintenance.  Obviously if you can bring support and maintenance to your own nation then the dollars spent at least stay in your own country however that isn't always possible, especially with cutting edge top of the line systems, like the F35. Anyone who owns and operates the F35 platform will need unfettered access to LMT resources and specialists in order to get anywhere close to 100% of the benefit you might expect to get from having these in your air force. Just keeping them flying without access to LMT might prove impossible, let alone using all the fancy bells and whistles which in some cases rely on access to US military satellites in orbit.

The other piece to this puzzle is that these planes take A LONG time to build. Canada ordered 88 planes for about $9,000,000,000 back in 2023 and they are expected to get their first batch of 16 sometime next year. And they have only paid for those first 16 so not much they can do about that. But there are 72 F35 planes at roughly $125,000,000 a pop that they haven't paid for but LMT has in their order books. This is Canada I'm speaking about, the nation that POTUS keeps insisting will become part of the USA (whether they want to or not) and has been using economic extortion to try and extract trade concessions. That already made the idea of buying these additional 72 plans dicey but then you had POTUS suddenly cancel all military maintenance and support contracts between US defense contractors and Ukraine. This was walked back a bit but it made everybody sit up and think about the fact that POTUS was so mercurial that the idea of buying incredibly expensive weapons that could be hobbled on the word of POTUS maybe isn't the best idea.

Since close of market on Friday the following has happened:

1. The nation of Portugal (which had previously said they intended to buy some F35s) has announced they will look for alternatives that are manufactured in Europe. These aren't firm orders but they do represent part of the potential customer based for the F35.
2. Then Turkiye, who has wanted to purchase the F35 for years and was prevented from doing so due to some geopolitical stuff announced that they would buy 40 fighter aircraft from the UK. Now these planes aren't nearly as good (or expensive as the F35) however the idea that Turkiye would invest what will end up being hundreds of millions of dollars into aircraft that aren't F35s and more importantly aren't from their usual military aircraft supplier (the USA) means that any future plans to purchase the F35 is now in doubt.
3. Canada has now announced they intend to look for alternatives to the F35 instead of moving forward with the purchase of an additional 72 planes. I don't know if this will mean they are breaking a contract or maybe it is just rescinding a statement of intent. That is a question I don't have the answer to at the moment but it really doesn't matter. These were sales that are currently reflected in the LMT stock price that are now, for all intents and purposes, cancelled.

So that is my play - I am going to be buying more puts on LMT to add to what I already have over time (current position below)

ETA: Picked up June 20th $400P x1 on 3/17/2025

I was already expecting a complete market crash as a result of POTUS' choices and actions. I've made some nice money in the last three weeks as a result. However I think we are just getting started and SOMETHING is going to lead to a bear market, possibly a depression. This thing with LMT could be the black swan that does it because when the market realizes the above is the reality of the situation there is a logical next thought: what about OTHER platforms and systems, whether made by LMT or other US defense contractors.

Buying Patriot air defense systems or already own some and think you might need to buy some ammunition? Maybe time to look around at diversifying your supplier for anti aircraft and anti missile systems in case POTUS decides he doesn't like you.

What about new tanks and armored transports? Probably not the kind of thing that relies as heavily on the manufacturer but spare parts and software updates will still be needed and if you have to switch to another supplier for additional vehicles down the road you will now have multiple platforms in operation which complicates logistics, training and operations, tactical operations, etc. That can impact decision making on new purchases.

Naval vessels? Advanced radar systems to use on the weapons platform (that flies, drives or sails) which you are purchasing from a different manufacturer? These are the most complex technical systems on the planet and often have components from different manufacturers. LMT might make the plane but it uses things made by RTX and other defense companies.

And this isn't something that you can easily fix. POTUS can promise to be nice and stay on his best behavior.... which I don't think he would even be willing to say let alone follow through on. But even if he did say it are militaries around the world going to want to have to rely on that? Can they risk having their nation's ability to defend itself hinge on the good will of someone who could favorably be described as inconsistent?

I don't know if the collapse of the US defense sector will lead to a complete market crash. But I think it has a chance. Either way I'm confident something will do that and in the mean time LMT puts seem rife with opportunity at the moment.

ETA:

The USA is the biggest customer for the US arms industry, \~70% of LMT's customers are right here in the USA:

In terms of my specific DD for this specific arms manufacturer at this specific moment in time - LMT is currently filling orders on what is the most expensive defense production run in human history. It is valued at over a trillion dollars for the life of the platform (from development, through production and to the end of post production support such as spare parts, software updates and maintenance). The vast majority of that mammoth expense was shouldered by the USA and funded design, development and early production. The plan originally was for many additional nations to place orders to meet per unit cost targets. But the system was just too expensive and there was actually a bit of a crisis from the early 2000's up until 2022 because the USA was basically the \*only\* customer which meant the entire cost of the project was on the USA. Then Russia invaded Ukraine and started doing war crimes in full view of satellites. Canada who had been on the fence for years suddenly ordered 88. The UK massively upped their order. A bunch of other nations in Europe and beyond placed or expanded orders and the cost per unit has plunged. All to say that the last 10 years have been all USA and the next 10 years were supposed to be mostly Europe, Middle East, South Asia, South East Asia, Australia/NZ, etc.

Also in general I am very bearish on many industries in the USA including defense\*

wallstreetbets,The Fed Is in Wait-and-See Mode. Investors Want Reassurance It Will Act If Needed,1jcvxbl,s1n0d3utscht3k,2025-03-16 17:14:18,938,0.97,188,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-16/fed-meeting-this-week-has-investors-anxiously-awaiting-powell-s-remarks,"Jerome Powell faces a tricky task this week of both assuring investors the economy remains on solid footing while also conveying policymakers stand ready to step in if necessary.

Even as the Federal Reserve chair has touted US resilience, uneasiness sparked by President Donald Trump’s rapidly escalating trade war has sent stocks tumbling over the past month. Bond yields are down, too, as is consumer sentiment as worries about the economic outlook mount.

“Powell needs to give some sort of a signal that they’re watching it,” said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. While the Fed chief will likely make it clear that officials don’t target the stock market, they can’t ignore the recent slide, he warned.

The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates steady when they meet March 18-19, but traders now see high odds of three rate cuts this year, most likely beginning in June. Economists generally expect two reductions, similar to what forecasters foresee policymakers’ updated projections to show Wednesday. 

Some investors caution that if officials continue to signal only two reductions in 2025, it becomes all the more important for the Fed chief to emphasize the central bank’s willingness to adjust borrowing costs if the labor market stumbles. 

“At the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,” said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. “But clearly they can’t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.” 

On top of the escalating and ever-changing tariff threats toward America’s largest trading partners, the Trump administration hasn’t done much to downplay recession risks. The president said March 9 that the US economy faces a “period of transition,” and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the US and markets are in need of a “detox.” 

*Market Reaction*

The two-year yield, most sensitive to the Fed’s monetary policy, has declined almost 60 basis points from a mid-January peak to a trough this month of 3.83%, the lowest level in over five months. And while stocks advanced on Friday, the move came after a selloff that culminated in a 10% plunge of the S&P 500 from its peak. Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — the VIX — at one point last week climbed to the highest levels since August.

Those market jitters have ramped up the stakes as officials release fresh economic projections that stand to offer insight into how much officials anticipate Trump’s policies will affect the economy. Policymakers are expected to slightly downgrade their forecasts for growth this year and bump up their outlook for so-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy.

But Powell will likely be reticent to guarantee investors the Fed will spring into action at the first signs of a faltering economy without a key caveat: Officials need to see evidence inflation is sustainably moving toward their 2% goal and that expectations for future price growth remain stable. 

“We’ll hear the message that things are still holding up, and that policy is in a good place where the Fed can react in either direction — whether that’s stubbornly high inflation or a more marked slowdown in the economy,” said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo & Co. “Now what I would like to hear more is just getting more clarity on how they are weighing the two sides of their mandate.”

While consumer prices rose at a slower pace in February and the producer price index was unchanged from a month earlier, the components that feed into the Fed’s preferred inflation measure — the personal consumption expenditures price index — were largely firmer. A closely watched measure of long-term inflation expectations climbed for a third month to a more than three-decade high. 

Such data limits the Fed’s ability to act and bolster the economy until the weakness starts to appear more directly in the labor market, said Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank AG. That could show up in the form of weaker payroll gains, a rise in the unemployment rate or a spike in layoffs, he said. 

“There’s lots of uncertainty that’s out there, and it’s possible that that filters into the hard data, but they are going to be in kind of a wait-and-see mode to see whether or not that happens,” said Luzzetti, who does not expect the Fed to lower rates this year. “At the same time, I think they’re seeing greater evidence that their job on inflation is not done.”

If the Fed were to confront a weakening economy amid still-elevated inflation, about two-thirds of economists in a Bloomberg survey said they would expect officials to hold borrowing costs steady.

Complicating the outlook is the possibility that other policies proposed by the Trump administration, such as tax cuts and deregulation, could boost the economy and inflation in the months ahead. Powell and his colleagues have emphasized they are watching to see what the “net effects” of Trump’s policies will be on the economy and want more clarity on the overall impact before adjusting policy. 

“Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,” Powell said earlier this month at an event in New York, his last public remarks before officials gather this week. “We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.”

*Balance Sheet*

Wall Street strategists will also be keen for any hints on the Fed’s plans to pause or further slow the speed at which the central bank is reducing its balance sheet — a process known as quantitative tightening or QT. Minutes of the January gathering revealed policymakers had discussed the potential need to pause or slow the process until lawmakers can strike a deal over the government’s debt ceiling.

“The argument for March is that the Fed has already talked about it,” said Blake Gwinn, head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “So why not just do it — as they can pause QT and then just restart it later.”

I figured it could be of use to some of you here who don't already know. 


For determining if stocks are in favor over safe haven assets I use
SPY/GLD 
SPY/TLT
These represent the flow of capital and the relative performance of the stock market to gold, and to bonds. When gold and bonds are starting to outperform stocks on a longer time frame like the weekly chart it is a warning sign. And historically the start of a multi year/decade long trend. These things play out over a long time. Which is good because it gives us time to react. The other helpful indicator is XLY/XLP which is consumer discretionary vs consumer staples. Think Amazon, apple, etc. Vs walmart, proctor and gamble, etc. When consumers are tapped and cut back on discretionary spending this ratio chart will show it. Consumers have to still buy staples like food, toilet paper, etc. And so money flows to safety in these stocks as well. (Although they typically only do well for a limited time prior to crashes and don't necessarily rise in market downturns, they just fall less)

From here if we determine that safe haven assets are starting to outperform its pretty easy and simple on what to do. Move capital out of stocks and into cash, bonds, and gold. How much into each is discretionary and kinda up to you on how much risk you are willing to take on by holding risk assets vs safe havens.

If we determine that stocks are in favor over safe havens, typically during the growth phase of the business cycle and after major market/economic corrections and crashes. This happens when liquidity is pumped into the system via central banks printing money and government issuing debt. They do this to stimulate the economy, create inflation and This is the time to take on risk and buy risk assets. Through out the bullmarket you will see different sectors out perform and to identify that I use a couple different ratios.
I like QQQ/DIA to determine if the market likes growth vs value and
IWM/SPY to identify market cap outperformance.

And then you can go all the way into the nitty gritty of sectors and in any combination you can compare these names to each other or to the broad market via the SPY

So while everyone was busy buying overpriced tech stocks and fighting over Tech crumbs, **European defense stocks**  **have been the real Players ?.** The sector has outperformed the global market **by 5x**, and Rheinmetall is basically a legal money printer (+200% YoY).

# Why?

Because w$r (or the fear of it) is **one hell of a business model.** Europe is suddenly remembering that p€ace doesn't come cheap, and government5 are **throwing cash at defense contractors** like they just discovered NAT0 has an invoice.

# Winners So Far:

🇩🇪 Rheinmetall: **+200%** (Did Germany just become a defense powerhouse again? Historically, that’s gone *great*.)  
🇳🇴 Kongsberg: **+127%** (Norway out here making missiles and oil money—diversification king.)  
🇮🇹 Leonardo: **+112%** (Italy cooking more than just pasta.) !?

# Still Room to Run?

Expected revenue growth says yes:  
🇩🇪 Rheinmetall: **+30% per year** (*We make tanks, we sell tanks, we make more tanks.*)  
🇫🇷 Dassault Aviation: **+21%** (*Jets go brrr.*)  
🇸🇪 Saab: **+15%** (*Sweden is supposed to be neutral but also wants to make money—respect.*)

# What’s Next?

* Europe isn't going to *stop* spending on defense anytime soon. If anything, **things are just getting started.**
* The best-performing companies have **strong margins** and **consistent government contracts**—less risk of a rug pull.
* The real question: **How much longer do these stocks run before they get overbought?**

I believe that this has impacted the market today and we can see this through historical data.

**Playboi Carti (Self Titled)** \- April 14th, 2017

Playboi Carti's first mixtape was released on April 14th, 2017. Although the market was closed that day, on the next trading day, April 17th, SPY went up +0.62%.

**Die Lit** \- May 11th, 2018

His next album was released on May 11th, 2018. The following trading session netted a +0.25% gain for SPY.

**Whole Lotta Red** \- December 25th, 2020

Released on Christmas Day, on the following trading session SPY went up again at a +0.12% gain. But when we compare it to the previous close, it gained +0.86%.

**Music** \- March 14th, 2025

Today, Playboi Carti released his newest album and the stock market response is clear. At the time of writing, SPY is up almost +2% with 1 hour to go until close. Clearly, the market rises every time Playboi Carti drops an album and this would explain the rise today.

Not as good as it could have been, because I've pussied out of some positions i've taken by taking profits earlier than I had originally planned to, because I wasn't sure if it would actually go where I wanted it to, but I'm happy either way.

Price: ~$184

Restaurants Owned: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille, Chuy's, Seasons 52, Eddie V's, and Bahama Breeze

My Postions:
5x 1/16/26 $185 puts
5x 1/16/26 $170 puts

Bear Case: 

With the current economic instability and uncertainty, many stocks from all industries have seen sharp decreases in value. For the case of this write up, I will mostly be focused on hotel, restaurant, and airline industries, since these industries are closely correlated and are considered elastic goods. Moreover, tourism to the United States, which is a key revenue source for these industries, will likely be down going forward due to rises in foreign tensions. Many Canadians are already talking about cancelling and boycotting travel to the United States, so these industries will feel the repercussions in the following months/years.

Airlines: 
Delta: -30% in the past month
United Airlines: -28% in the past month
American Airlines: -30% in the past month

Restaurants/Food:
Sbux: -12.7% in the past month
Cava: -37% in the past month
Wingstop: -30% in the past month
Chipotle: -14% in the past month

Hotels:
Hyatt: -15.33% in the past month
Mariott: -15.4% in the past month
Hilton: -15.26% in the past month

$DRI has not yet taken a hit from the recent economic turmoil, only dropping 5% in the past month. Due to the target audience of its restaurants, I believe that they are more susceptible to the affects of a recession than fast food restaurants such as Wingstop, Chipotle, and Cava, which have seen significant dips recently. 

Restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse are treated as a night out for lower class/lower middle class Americans, and will be among the first expenses to be cut when their budgets inevitably tighten. I believe in the case of a recession, more Americans will ditch restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse than Chipotle, Wingstop, and Cava.

For reference here is how $DRI performed during the past recessions/pullbacks

2008: -68.5% decrease
2020: -63% decrease
2022: -25% decrease

I believe $DRI has much room to fall over the next year and maybe even longer.

wallstreetbets,Intel Shares Jump As Much As 19% After Naming Chip Industry Veteran Tan CEO,1jacsj2,s1n0d3utscht3k,2025-03-13 10:07:56,1619,0.98,181,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-12/intel-names-chip-industry-veteran-lip-bu-tan-as-its-next-ceo,"Shares of Intel Corp. jumped the most in five years after the company named Lip-Bu Tan as its next chief executive officer. 

The announcement stoked optimism from investors, who sent the stock up as much as 19% after markets opened in New York on Thursday, its biggest intraday gain since March 2020. [But remains at 2009 levels.]

Tan, 65, will assume the role on March 18, the company said in a statement Wednesday. He will rejoin the board as well after stepping down in August 2024. […] [Intel is] entrusting a former board member and semiconductor veteran with one of the toughest jobs in the chip industry. 

Tan, the former head of Cadence Design Systems Inc., is tasked with restoring the fortunes of a pioneering chipmaker that’s become an industry laggard. Intel, which dominated the semiconductor field for decades, is struggling with market-share losses, manufacturing setbacks and a precipitous decline in its earnings. It’s also burdened with debt and recently had to slash about 15,000 jobs.

Bank of America Corp. analysts also upgraded the shares to “neutral” after the announcement, citing Tan’s “solid track record.” Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, the stock had declined more than 50% over the past 12 months as the company’s future became increasingly murky.

“That’s not to say it will be easy. It won’t be,” he said. “But I am joining because I believe with every fiber of my being that we have what it takes to win. Intel plays an essential role in the technology ecosystem, both in the US and around the world.”

Tan’s predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was pushed out by the board for a perceived failure to rejuvenate Intel’s product lineup. One of the most glaring challenges: creating an artificial intelligence accelerator chip that can rival the products of Nvidia Corp. That company, once in Intel’s shadow, has seen its revenue and valuation skyrocket over the past two years due to the AI computing boom.

Intel remains one of the world’s biggest chipmakers by revenue, with more than $50 billion in annual sales. Its processors are the main component in more than 70% of the world’s personal computers and server machines. And the company’s factories still represent a large chunk of worldwide capacity for advanced manufacturing.

In 2024, Intel was by far the lowest performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, declining 60%. As the company’s valuation plummeted back to 1990s levels, the once-unthinkable idea of an Intel takeover has become more plausible.

Fast forward to 2025, and the Nasdaq looks like it’s trying to relive its glory days.

Stocks like Nvidia are taking the plunge—down nearly 30%—while the broader index is doing its best impression of a nervous cat on a slippery floor. The parallels are clear: tech innovation is booming, but volatility is lurking around every corner

wallstreetbets,DD: Most Undervalued Mid-Cap (CORZ) (very long and detailed analysis),1j9v90b,Complex-Rip-4957,2025-03-12 17:24:46,13,0.71,15,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j9v90b,"TL;DR: Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) is wildly undervalued and the market is sleeping on it. This company has transformed from a troubled Bitcoin miner into a data center powerhouse riding the AI wave – and it’s already generating serious revenue. With a massive $12B OpenAI deal validating its strategy (through partner CoreWeave), a high-margin, long-term AI hosting contract kicking in, and Wall Street still pricing it like a simple crypto miner, CORZ presents a high-upside, strong conviction play. I hold 5,000 shares and couldn’t be more confident. Below I’ll break down why I believe CORZ can rip higher in the short, medium, and long term – with price targets of $12 (short-term), $20 (medium-term), and $30+ (long-term) – based on hard data and catalysts the market is blatantly overlooking.

From Bitcoin Miner to AI Data Center Leader

Core Scientific operates large-scale data centers (like its Denton, TX facility pictured above) that were originally built for Bitcoin mining – and it’s now repurposing this infrastructure to power the AI revolution.

Just a year ago, Core Scientific was known primarily as one of North America’s largest Bitcoin miners. It mined a record 13,762 BTC in 2023 – more than any other publicly traded miner ￼. But after navigating a tough crypto bear market and slashing $400M of debt in bankruptcy restructuring (saving ~$60M in interest costs annually ￼), CORZ emerged in 2024 with a new lease on life and a new mission. Management recognized the huge opportunity in AI and high-performance computing (HPC), and they’ve struck a game-changing deal to pivot into that space ￼ ￼.

Today, Core Scientific isn’t just a crypto play – it’s fast becoming a major data center player for AI. In June 2024, the company inked a transformative 12-year contract to provide ~200 megawatts (MW) of its data center capacity to CoreWeave, the AI cloud provider ￼. Under this deal, CORZ will host CoreWeave’s cutting-edge NVIDIA GPU rigs in its facilities, effectively turning its mining centers into AI supercomputing hubs. The site modifications are already underway and expected to be operational by mid-2025 ￼. This is a big deal – literally. Once fully up and running, that initial contract is estimated to generate **over $3.5 billion in revenue for Core Scientific over 12 years (about $290M per year) ￼. Even better, the hosting revenues come with approx. 75–80% gross margins ￼, far more predictable and stable than volatile Bitcoin mining profits. In other words, CORZ is locking in a decade of high-margin, recurring cash flow from the AI boom.

And that’s just the beginning. CoreWeave was so satisfied that it exercised an option for an extra 70 MW within weeks ￼, expanding the partnership. This adds another ~$1.2B in contracted revenue (bringing total HPC contract value to ~$4.7B!) ￼ ￼. All told, CORZ now has ~500 MW of its capacity contracted for AI/HPC through CoreWeave between 2025–2026 ￼ ￼. For context, that is massive scale – comparable to or bigger than many established data center operators. In fact, with 1.2 GW (1,200 MW) of total power capacity across its sites, Core Scientific is positioned to be one of the largest data center operators in the U.S. ￼ ￼. Roughly 70% of its infrastructure is now earmarked for AI/HPC hosting versus 30% for Bitcoin, yet the stock still isn’t being valued like a data center company ￼. This disconnect is our opportunity.

Future Profitability & Growth Trajectory 🚀

The growth trajectory here is off the charts. Core Scientific’s legacy mining business is already cash-generative (especially with Bitcoin rebounding – BTC has climbed from ~$17k at end of 2022 to ~$43k by end of 2023 ￼, greatly improving mining economics). CORZ continues to mine ~16–19 BTC per day from its own fleet ￼ ￼, and it’s deploying next-gen miners to boost efficiency. But the real game-changer is the HPC hosting side coming online:
	•	Stable High-Margin Revenue: Starting in 2025, Core Scientific will begin raking in ~$290M/year in AI hosting revenue from the CoreWeave contract ￼. Unlike mining, this is dollar-denominated, fixed-fee revenue – not subject to coin price swings. Gross margins are expected to be 75–80% ￼, which will supercharge profitability. Essentially, CORZ is becoming a hybrid of a crypto miner and a high-margin data center REIT.
	•	Predictable Cash Flow: Management highlighted that AI hosting provides a level of predictability that mining lacks ￼. Power costs and BTC prices can whipsaw mining profits, but the HPC contracts lock in client payments and even have the client (CoreWeave) funding much of the build-out capex ￼. This dramatically de-risks the business model going forward. We’re talking recurring revenue for 12+ years from Tier-1 AI clients.
	•	Expansion and Upside: Core Scientific isn’t stopping at 270 MW for CoreWeave. They have ~130+ MW of additional capacity ready to contract with other AI customers ￼ ￼. Management explicitly said they are in discussions with other potential HPC clients to capitalize on their “significant pipeline of powered real estate” ￼. The demand is there – in fact, analysts at the recent investor day swarmed them with questions about the AI contracts, not mining ￼, showing where the future lies. Any new contracts (think other cloud providers, government, universities, etc.) would be gravy on top of the CoreWeave deal. There’s room to easily sign hundreds more MW in the coming years, given their planned expansions in Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama and more.
	•	Operating Leverage: With debt reduced and interest costs down, plus legacy infrastructure already in place, much of the new revenue will drop to the bottom line. Even before the AI pivot, CORZ was delivering positive adjusted EBITDA. Now, factor in $300M+ of high-margin annual AI revenue, plus a potential Bitcoin bull cycle (post-2024 halving and potential ETF approvals) boosting mining profits… you get the picture. This company could be printing cash in 2025 and beyond. Bernstein analysts actually project CORZ turning net-profitable in 2025 as the AI hosting ramps up ￼. The “crypto miner that went bankrupt” narrative is outdated – Core Scientific is now a cash flow machine in the making.

Bottom line: The growth trajectory is dual-powered – steady AI hosting revenue growth and optionality on Bitcoin’s upside. If BTC runs again (many expect a major move in the next 1-2 years due to the halving and institutional adoption), CORZ’s mining division (still one of the largest with ~19.4 EH/s hashpower ￼ ￼) will mint money. If BTC stagnates, CORZ still wins big from AI. This balanced model means multiple shots on goal for explosive growth. It’s hard to find a company with this kind of asymmetric upside already trading at a single-digit stock price.

OpenAI’s $12B Deal Validates CORZ’s Long-Term Vision

One of the strongest confirmations of Core Scientific’s strategy came just this week: OpenAI signed a $12 billion, five-year deal with CoreWeave ￼. Yes, the same CoreWeave that partnered with CORZ. This is huge news for the AI infrastructure space and hugely bullish for Core Scientific by association.

Why? OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) is essentially saying they need massive GPU cloud capacity outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave, which specializes in GPU hosting, is now on the hook to deliver a ton of AI compute to OpenAI ￼. We’re talking about potentially building out one of the world’s largest AI supercomputing footprints. And guess who is a key supplier of that footprint? Core Scientific.

CoreWeave has contracted 500 MW of Core Scientific’s data centers to meet its clients’ AI needs ￼. The OpenAI deal alone will likely soak up every bit of that and more, meaning CoreWeave may need to exercise further expansion options with CORZ or invest in new sites (likely both). It underscores that demand for AI data center capacity is practically insatiable right now. In 2024, CoreWeave’s revenue exploded 8× from $229M to $1.9 billion thanks largely to AI deals with customers like Microsoft ￼. Now with OpenAI’s multi-year $12B commitment, CoreWeave’s revenue will go parabolic – and Core Scientific is integral to supplying that growth ￼.

To put it simply: the AI gold rush is on, and CORZ is selling the shovels (power + space). The OpenAI-CoreWeave partnership de-risks Core Scientific’s long-term prospects even further. It’s tangible proof that AI compute is the future, and CORZ’s massive power infrastructure is exactly what’s needed to capitalize on it. Every major AI player will be scrambling for data center capacity. Core Scientific has some of the largest ready-to-go sites in North America – a fact not lost on those in the know. (Remember, CoreWeave even tried to acquire Core Scientific for $5.75/share in cash ￼ last year, and was flatly rejected as “undervalued” – more on that below.)

Oh, and about Microsoft – there was a fear floating around that Microsoft might back away from using CoreWeave (which could have indirectly hurt CORZ). That rumor was put to rest decisively. CoreWeave denied any contract cancellations with Microsoft and called such reports “false and misleading” ￼. In fact, Microsoft has massive multi-year plans with CoreWeave (reportedly intending to spend $10B+ on CoreWeave’s services by 2030) ￼. So the largest customer relationships are intact, and now OpenAI is piling on with its own gargantuan deal. In short, the HPC side of CORZ’s business is rock-solid and about to experience torrid growth on the back of these AI mega-deals.

Market Misperception: Not Just a “Mining Company” Anymore

Despite everything outlined above, many investors still think of Core Scientific as a Bitcoin mining stock. Old habits die hard – and that’s why this opportunity exists. The stock came out of bankruptcy in January and was re-listed at just a few bucks, and many probably wrote it off as “another crypto casualty.” The reality couldn’t be more different now. CORZ is morphing into a hybrid AI infrastructure play, but the market hasn’t caught up to this narrative yet.

Here’s the misperception: “It’s a miner, so it should trade at mining valuations.” Many mining companies trade at low multiples because of volatile earnings and past boom-bust cycles. Core Scientific, however, now has much more in common with data center operators like Equinix (EQIX) or Digital Realty (DLR) than with pure miners. Don’t take my word for it – Bernstein’s tech analyst Gautam Chhugani explicitly notes that CORZ’s valuation today “aligns more closely with Bitcoin mining rather than data center valuations, [even though] 70% of its capacity is dedicated to AI.” ￼ In other words, Wall Street is pricing CORZ all wrong. The company is being valued like a shrinking, risky crypto miner when in fact it’s a growing, diversified digital infrastructure firm with both crypto and AI tailwinds.

Consider this: Core Scientific will have 800+ MW in HPC data centers and ~400 MW in mining. Equinix, the king of data centers, operates ~240 data centers globally, but their total power capacity is on the order of only a few hundred MW in many markets. Digital Realty similarly has a large footprint but trades at 20+ times FFO (funds from operations) because of its stable data center income. Core Scientific’s HPC contracts are bringing in exactly that kind of stable income, yet CORZ trades at a tiny fraction of the valuation metrics of EQIX/DLR. It’s like buying a data center stock for the price of a distressed crypto stock – a total disconnect.

Let’s put some numbers on it: At around ~$8–9 per share (as of this week), CORZ’s market cap is roughly $4.5 billion (the market hasn’t updated fully to the growth story) ￼. For that price, you’re getting 1.2 GW of capacity, $4.7B in contracted AI revenue over the next decade, plus the largest Bitcoin mining operation in North America (which mined 6,300+ BTC in 2024) ￼. By contrast, DLR’s market cap is around $30B and Equinix’s is around $70B – and neither of them has a call option on Bitcoin reaching six figures 😉.

Now, I’m not saying CORZ should be worth $30B today, but it absolutely deserves a major re-rating as it proves out this HPC pivot. The company itself recognized the undervaluation: remember, when CoreWeave offered $5.75/share cash for the company last summer, the board rejected it for undervaluing CORZ ￼. That was when Bitcoin was lower and before the $12B OpenAI deal even existed – so imagine how much more they’d scoff at $5.75 now. Insiders clearly believe the company is worth a lot more, and so do I.

Every earnings report and press release going forward is likely to shift the narrative and wake more investors up. Already, research analysts are taking note. Besides Bernstein (Buy, $17 PT), KBW initiated coverage with a Buy and a $22 target ￼. The language from these analysts is telling – they highlight CORZ’s “strategic partnerships with cloud players like CoreWeave” and its ability to deploy hybrid AI/Bitcoin data centers quickly as key reasons it’s “well-placed to capitalize” on the AI boom ￼. This is strong validation that smart money sees the shift. As these data points permeate and the company delivers actual results (e.g., later in 2025 when the AI revenue hits the income statement in a big way), I expect a cascade of revaluation.

In summary, the market’s old perception = “CORZ is a bankrupt miner, avoid.” The new reality = “CORZ is a profitable digital infrastructure company with huge AI contracts and a Bitcoin kicker.” We are still closer to the former in terms of stock price, which is exactly why this is the most undervalued future bet I see right now. The market is asleep at the wheel, and we plan to wake up smiling.

Undervaluation Relative to Peers (EQIX, DLR) – By the Numbers

To really drive home how mispriced CORZ is, let’s do a quick peer comparison. Equinix and Digital Realty are the blue chips of data centers – known for steady earnings, high occupancy, etc. Investors pay a premium for that stability. Equinix (EQIX) trades around ~25x EV/EBITDA and ~8x sales. Digital Realty (DLR) trades ~20x EV/EBITDA. Both have dividend yields under 3% – meaning investors accept low yields because they trust the long-term demand for data centers. These companies also grow in single-digit percentages per year (organically), with big capex needs to add capacity.

Now look at Core Scientific: In 2024, even without the full HPC ramp, it pulled in about ~$100M per quarter in revenue from mining ￼ (so ~$400M annual run-rate). Add $290M/yr from the first HPC phase starting 2025 ￼, and we get ~$700M annual revenue potential. If Bitcoin prices rise, mining revenue could easily push that over $1 billion. So let’s ballpark $1B+ revenue in 2025-26. At the current ~$4.5B market cap, that’s roughly 4.5× P/Sales. Equinix by contrast trades at ~10× sales. Even if we haircut for the mining portion’s volatility, CORZ’s AI hosting portion alone arguably deserves a similar multiple to data center peers once it’s fully online (given 12-year contracts = very “REIT-like” revenue). On $300M of high-quality AI revenue, a 10× multiple would value that segment at $3B. The mining segment, at 6,000+ BTC/year production (which at $50k BTC would be $300M revenue), could also be worth a few billion easily in a bull case. Sum-of-parts, it’s not hard to envision $6B–$8B+ valuation in the near future, which translates to stock price in the mid to high teens. And that doesn’t account for further AI contracts or Bitcoin reaching new highs, which could push numbers even higher.

Another way to look at it: Enterprise Value per MW of data center capacity. Data centers often change hands at around $10M+ per MW (depending on location and clients). Core Scientific at $4.5B EV for 1,200 MW is only about $3.75M per MW – dirt cheap. If you value the 800 MW of AI capacity at, say, $8M/MW (still a discount to typical hyperscale DC deals, considering these are cutting-edge GPU facilities), that’s $6.4B right there. Add some value for the 400 MW mining capacity (which isn’t worthless – it produces BTC and can be repurposed if needed), and you easily justify $8B–$10B EV. That would put the stock roughly in the $20s. It’s not pie-in-the-sky; it’s just basic sum-of-parts with reasonable peer comps.

Finally, remember that Core Scientific’s management already turned down a full cash buyout at $5.75 because they believed it wasn’t fair value ￼. They had much more insight into their pipeline and prospects (and boy, were they right – since then we’ve seen the AI pipeline explode). Insiders are aligned with us in wanting a MUCH higher price. As an investor, that refusal of a buyout is incredibly bullish – it tells me management genuinely thinks the stock is worth multiples of that offer.

Key Catalysts Ahead

This isn’t a “sit and wait for years” story – I see multiple near-term and medium-term catalysts that could rerate CORZ significantly. Here are the key ones to watch:
	•	HPC Go-Live (Mid-2025): In the next few months, Core Scientific will be completing the modifications and powering up that first 200 MW for CoreWeave’s AI workloads ￼. When that goes live (anticipated H1 2025), CORZ can start recognizing the hosting revenue. We might get updates or even initial revenue in Q3 2025 results. The market often prices things in early, so as this milestone nears, expect increasing buzz around CORZ as an “AI infrastructure play”. There may also be ribbon-cutting PR events (like the one in Muskogee, OK for a new 100 MW center ￼ ￼) to draw investor attention.
	•	New HPC Contracts: Management has hinted at discussions with additional AI/cloud clients ￼. Any announcement of a new contract (e.g., leasing another 100+ MW to a different hyperscaler or government project) would be a huge catalyst. It would prove CoreWeave isn’t the only one knocking on the door. Keep an eye on press releases – CORZ has been expanding into new regions (recently Auburn, Alabama facility announced in Feb 2025 ￼ ￼) specifically to support more HPC customers. We could wake up to a headline like “Core Scientific signs $X billion contract with [Big Tech or Government] for AI data center capacity” – and the stock would likely gap up on that.
	•	Bitcoin Halving & ETF Mania: The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 cut block rewards in half, which historically precedes big BTC bull runs in the subsequent year or two. We’re now post-halving, and there’s a strong narrative for a 2025 crypto upcycle (potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by BlackRock or others, increased mainstream adoption, etc.). If Bitcoin’s price surges, Core Scientific’s mining profitability will skyrocket (since they are highly leveraged to BTC price, mining 16+ BTC daily). Even a move back to Bitcoin’s prior highs ($60k–$65k) would more than double mining revenue from current levels. That would provide upside surprise in earnings and further cash to invest in expansions or pay down any remaining debt. In short, a crypto bull run would be icing on the cake – not required for our thesis, but it could send the stock into an even higher gear.
	•	CoreWeave IPO: CoreWeave filed for an IPO in March 2025 ￼. When that IPO happens, it will likely shine a big spotlight on the value of AI infrastructure companies. If CoreWeave comes out with a huge valuation (some speculate tens of billions given the OpenAI deal and revenue trajectory), people will do the math and realize “hey, a big chunk of CoreWeave’s infrastructure is actually provided by Core Scientific.” Investors might look for a cheaper proxy – and CORZ fits the bill perfectly. Essentially, CORZ could get a sympathy re-rating when CoreWeave IPOs, as a way to play the AI data center theme without paying an IPO premium.
	•	Earnings Surprises / Guidance: As soon as CORZ’s management starts giving forward guidance that includes the HPC contracts, analysts will need to update their models upward. We could see this in late 2024 or early 2025 earnings calls, where they might guide for hundreds of millions in hosting revenue in 2025/26. Any hint of raising forecasts will make the stock pop. Additionally, if their monthly operational updates (which currently report BTC mined, etc.) start to include HPC metrics, that will educate the market. They already mention that they are converting a significant portion of data centers to AI workloads ￼ – soon we’ll see actual numbers to attach to that.
	•	Index Inclusion & Institutional Buying: Having emerged from bankruptcy and re-listed on Nasdaq, CORZ can now be included in indices again. It may also graduate from being seen as “distressed” to being a legitimate growth stock. As fundamentals improve, more institutions will be able to buy in (some couldn’t touch it during bankruptcy or OTC trading). We might also see hedge funds and big-name investors take positions once they recognize the turnaround. Any such filings or mentions (e.g., a famous value investor or tech fund taking a stake) would be a catalyst.

In short, there is no shortage of catalysts. This isn’t some cigar-butt value trap – it’s a dynamic situation with news flow likely skewed to the positive for quite some time. Wall Street is behind the curve, and each catalyst is an alarm clock ringing to wake them up.

Strong Conviction: My Price Targets (Short, Medium, Long Term)

I’ve laid out the facts and the thesis – now let’s talk price targets and upside. As mentioned, I’m holding 5,000 shares of CORZ and I intend to hold (if not add) because I see massive upside from current levels. Here’s where I realistically see the stock going:
	•	Short Term (next 3–6 months): $12+ – In the short run, I expect CORZ to trade into the double digits as the market starts pricing in the HPC contract ramp and the AI news flow. Recall that management already said $5.75 was too low ￼; we’re now well above that, but still in single digits. I think $10–$12 is very achievable on just a bit more recognition, which would still only be ~5x sales and a discount to peers. Short-term catalysts like continued strong Bitcoin production (they mined 471 BTC just in the first two months of 2025 ￼) and any hints of additional AI deals could push us to this range quickly. In my view, the downside is pretty limited now that the company is out of bankruptcy and cash-flow positive, so risk/reward is skewed to the upside. Near-term target: $12.
	•	Medium Term (12–18 months): $18–$20 – Over the next year or so (by end of 2025), I see CORZ in the high teens at least. This coincides with the period when the CoreWeave contract will be fully operational and printing revenue. Bernstein’s official target is $17 ￼, and KBW’s is $22 ￼; my own model splits the difference. By 2025, the company should be solidly profitable, with perhaps $300M+ annual EBITDA (my rough estimate combining mining + hosting). Slapping even a 10× EBITDA multiple would give ~$3B enterprise value, and I suspect CORZ will command higher given growth rates – hence a stock around $18–20 makes sense. This also assumes Bitcoin maybe in the $40k–$50k range (conservative) and no major new HPC contracts beyond what’s announced (also conservative). Any positive surprise (e.g., BTC at $70k or another 100MW contract) and we could easily break $20. 12–18 month target: ~$20.
	•	Long Term (2–3 years+): $30+ (multi-bagger) – Looking out a few years, I believe CORZ can trade north of $30, making it a potential multi-bagger from here. By that time (2026–2027), Core Scientific could have several AI clients, 800+ MW of AI load generating perhaps $600M+/yr in revenue, and still mining a significant amount of Bitcoin with next-next-gen ASICs (they are already planning 2025 miner refresh with 3nm chips ￼). If Bitcoin hits new all-time highs in that timeframe (which I personally expect), the mining side alone could be worth the current market cap (!). Meanwhile, the data center side would be maturing into a full-fledged co-location giant. It’s not crazy to think CORZ could approach a $10B+ valuation if all cylinders fire – which would put the stock roughly in the $30s. Consider that the company nearly sold for ~$6B ($5.75/share) when it was in bankruptcy distress; with a stronger balance sheet and booming business, $30 (equating to maybe ~$15B if dilution is minimal) is a reasonable long-term aspiration. And if we dream a bit: should CORZ eventually spin off its AI data center arm as a REIT or get acquired by a big player, we could see even more upside. But I’ll stay grounded and stick to $30+ as my long-term base case. That’s roughly a triple from here – exactly the kind of asymmetrical upside that deep due diligence can uncover.

Conclusion: High-Upside, Well-Researched, and the Market is Asleep

To wrap up, Core Scientific is, in my opinion, the most undervalued “picks and shovels” play on both AI and crypto out there. The company has already proven resilient – surviving a brutal downturn, emerging stronger, and immediately seizing one of the biggest opportunities of our era (AI compute). They are already profitable on an operating basis, have secured billions in future revenues, and still retain the explosive upside of Bitcoin mining. Yet, because it’s a former bankrupt crypto name, most investors haven’t caught on to the transformation. This is the kind of setup deep-value and growth investors dream about: a misunderstood stock with improving fundamentals and multiple catalysts on deck.

I’m pounding the table with strong conviction on CORZ. I’ve put my money where my mouth is (5,000 shares and holding) because I see what others are missing. If you believe in the future of AI (and the infrastructure needed to run it) and you believe in the long-term value of Bitcoin, this is a no-brainer combination play. Even if you’re only bullish on one of those, CORZ offers a compelling risk-reward skew.

The market is clearly sleeping on this opportunity, but it won’t stay asleep forever. The facts are coming out quarter by quarter, contract by contract. In my view, it’s only a matter of time before Core Scientific is re-rated from “ex-miner penny stock” to “premier digital infrastructure growth stock.” By then, the easy money will have been made. That’s why the time to get in is now, while it’s undervalued and before the broader market wakes up.

Disclosure: I am long CORZ (5,000 shares) and have no plans to sell in the foreseeable future. I wrote this DD because I believe in the thesis and want to share the research – but of course, do your own due diligence. This is not financial advice, just one highly confident investor’s perspective. I welcome any counterpoints or additional insights.

As of this writing S&P is up by 0.8%. 

There is a strong argument that the slower month-on-month CPI increase is due to weak consumer demand. Look at the breakdown of the categories.

Airline fares and gasoline prices dropped by 4.0% and 1.0% respectively. This suggests weaker consumer demand for travel.

New vehicle prices declined by 0.1%. This indicates consumers are holding back on large discretionary purchases. This also aligns with the consumer confidence index from a couple of weeks back which highlighted a drop in sentiment on large purchases in the near future by consumers

Overall the CPI and core CPI numbers reinforce my opinion that the economy is not doing well. Consumers are pulling back and businesses do not feel confident raising prices any more. This will reflect in the next set of readings - both inflation and labor market.

Smoot-Hawley Tariffs (USA, 1930-1934)*
**Effects:** Deepened the Great Depression by triggering international retaliation. U.S. trade collapsed by over 60%. Consumers faced higher prices while farmers lost export markets. Contributed to bank failures and prolonged economic suffering until reversed by the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.

*2. Import Substitution Industrialization (Latin America, 1950s-1970s)*
**Effects:** Initially created manufacturing jobs and reduced import dependency. However, led to inefficient industries, technological stagnation, and limited consumer choices. Consumers paid higher prices for lower-quality goods. Eventually contributed to the Latin American debt crisis as protected industries couldn't compete globally.

*3. Japanese Auto Quotas (USA, 1980s)*
**Effects:** Protected U.S. automakers but increased car prices by an estimated $1,000 per vehicle for American consumers. Created windfall profits for Japanese manufacturers who shifted to higher-end vehicles. American automakers delayed necessary modernization. Cost American consumers approximately $5 billion annually.

*4. South Korean Development Tariffs (1960s-1980s)*
**Effects:** Initially supported industrial development when combined with export promotion policies. Temporary protection allowed industries like steel and electronics to develop. However, consumers paid higher prices, and eventual liberalization proved difficult politically. Successful mainly because protection was strategic, temporary, and tied to export performance requirements.

*5. U.S.-China Trade War (2018-2020)*
**Effects:** Caused American consumers to pay approximately $51 billion in additional costs annually. Protected some manufacturing jobs but created job losses in agriculture and manufacturing sectors using imported inputs. Reduced farm exports due to Chinese retaliation. U.S. companies absorbed about 75% of the costs rather than Chinese exporters. GDP growth slowed by an estimated 0.3% while inflation increased.

Each case demonstrates how tariffs create concentrated benefits for specific industries while typically imposing broader costs across the economy through higher prices and reduced economic efficiency.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Normally in economics, we would argue that results from the past cannot be extrapolated to the future, but with the current market conditions, I’m not so sure. How should we approach this situation?

*Trump's steel, aluminum tariffs take effect as global trade war intensifies*

By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal

March 12, 2025 12:33 AM CDT

Important Bits: 

> WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday, stepping up a campaign to reorder global trade norms in favor of the U.S. that drew swift retaliation from Europe.

> Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25% on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.

> The European Commission responded almost immediately, saying it would impose counter tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods from next month.

> Close U.S. allies Canada, Britain and Australia criticised the blanket tariffs, with Canada mulling reciprocal actions and British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds saying ""all options were on the table"" to respond in the national interest.

. . . .

> On Monday, Carney said he could not speak with Trump until he was sworn in as prime minister. Trump again on social media said he wanted Canada ""to become our cherished Fifty First State.""

> Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told Reuters that Canada could impose non-tariff measures such as restricting oil exports to the U.S. or levying export duties on minerals, if U.S. tariffs persist.

> Canada ships about 4 million barrels of crude to the U.S. per day via pipeline, mainly to Midwest refineries. Canadian tariffs on American ethanol are also an option, he added.

> Ottawa last week won a month's reprieve for USMCA-compliant exports from Trump's general 25% tariffs for Canada threatened over fentanyl trafficking.

> But in early April, Canada also faces Trump's reciprocal tariffs aimed at raising U.S. tariffs to match other countries' rates and counteract non-tariff barriers.

> A small business survey on Tuesday showed sentiment weakening for a third straight month, fully eroding a confidence boost following Trump's November 5 election victory, and a survey of households by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their finances, inflation and the job market.",0,,2025-03-12,-0.5994,0.5916,0.0,0.8644776940345764,0.75,0.25,-0.30165,0.2161194235086441,-0.042765288245677935,47.861735587716105,neutral
wallstreetbets,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,1j9cirg,kico_kico,2025-03-12 01:44:56,28,0.78,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j9cirg/ai_trade_simply_out_of_juice_or_starting_to/,"The S&P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I’m referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I’ve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

In their latest earnings call, while they had revenue from research collaborations, both IONQ and RGTI do not have a commercially viable product, nor do they even have a realistic timeline to one. Both claim, maybe 2030...and quantum computers have always been ""5 more years!""

Some facts - The RGTI CEO is focused on fidelity - improving accuracy a projected 2x this year! To be commercially viable ""like an NVIDIA GPU"" requires 100,000,000 X accuracy gains...

Quantum Advantage is not a given at lower fidelity rates either.

The commercial TAMS they claim Quantum will help are not limited by compute (drug discovery, networking, crypto, NFTs, AI, etc.)

And now we get to the event coming up; NVIDIA's Quantum Day.

These stocks went into free fall when Jensen and Zuckerberg admitted quantum tech is many decades out from relevance.

Jensen then saved them by stating he was going to host quantum day; MSFT the same day announced for companies to be ""quantum ready for 2025!"" in a blog post.

We have to ask ourselves why? And what is happening at quantum day?

The WHY behind NVDA and MSFT is simple - right after this hype marketing on quantum, MSFT reported dissapointing cloud sales to enterprise. MSFT cap-ex on NVIDIA GPUS is dependent on these units sales. MSFT offers the ability to play around with these quantum computers on their cloud for research purposes - though they are typically down and worthless but they do consume a TON of compute.

This not only marked the top of the market because why would MSFT and NVDA need to pump quantum if AI is going HAM? It's an act of desperation by their marketing teams, simple as.

Finally the coup de grace - QUANTUM DAY (RED WEDDING)

Who is the guest on the same level as NVDA? Crowdstrike. Why? Because the only real application for quantum computers long term is encryption breaking...important for security. The only issue here is; Crowdstrike is invested in avoiding that for their customers so they will DEFINITELY outline how they will invalidate this technology.

When the market realizes the only potential use for quantum in decades will be invalidated by tech from players like CRWD, its a headshot.

To add insult to injury, IONQ's CEO who is attending the NVDIA conference has been comparing themselves to 2015 NVIDIA...claiming Jensen is afraid of them...lol

This CEO is a serial SPACer and midwit.

Enjoy shorting this or buy puts. I think all will work out. Not financial advice. Maybe buy some short term calls to hedge.

Short with April hedges.

wallstreetbets,MicroStrategy (MSTR/STRK) now officially a Ponzi? To hold Bitcoin Bros hostage?,1j8k5ai,JulianHabekost,2025-03-11 02:03:16,1323,0.94,403,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j8k5ai/microstrategy_mstrstrk_now_officially_a_ponzi_to/,"Regardless what you think of Bitcoin, I think MSTR successfully did it, it qualifies for the official Ponzi-Scheme certificate.

So MicroStrategy (the company that basically doesn't do anything beside holding Bitcoin while trading at 1.5 it's Bitcoin holding's dollar price in market capitalization) issued a preferred stock called STRK. It looks like a Bond, it has a nominal value and it gets a ""fixed dividend"" of 8% annually, every quarter. But if you look at the very complicated prospectus at the SEC, it looks to me as if MicroStrategy doesn't actually need to pay anything at any time. They can always ""default"" on the payment without anything happening other than that the dividend is added to the nominal value and still owed ""later"", kind of like a credit card that can't demand to pay the debt.

So people, even in the crypto space, were asking how they are gonna pay their first dividends on the 500M$ of STRK that are due March 15th. Regardless of how Bitcoin develops, Michael Saylor, the CEO, repeats the mantra ""never sell you Bitcoin"" like in a cult. But MicroStrategy has no significant income, where should the money come from?

One possibility was that they right away ""default"" on their first STRK dividends. Oopsy doopsy no money, who could have foreseen that. But the bond price would have collapsed and there is also an option to get one MSTR common share for 10 STRKs, so if the bond trades under 1/10 of the stock, yesterday morning around 250$/10=25$, that could be a risk.

So instead Michael Saylor (the CEO) announced yesterday that MicroStrategy, now called Strategy, is issuing 21B$ more of those STRK worst-of-both-worlds bonds/stocks. A week before the dividends on the first batch is due. Saylor basically told everyone he is not going to sell Bitcoin, so the only conclusion is he has to borrow more to pay out earlier investors with later investors. If he pays the dividends in a week, there is no doubt where that money came from. Earlier investors payout with later investors, that's the official definition of a Ponzi

I'm sure if he had the option he would have waited with issuing the second batch of 21B$ STRK one fucking week to avoid this insanely strong Ponzi smell and pay those early batch STRK from whatever legitimate income MSTR has, but oops there is none.

But who is gonna buy that junk? If you believe in Bitcoin mooning, why invest in an 8% bond instead? If you don't believe in Bitcoin, why would you believe MSTR will magically come up with the money to pay you? The answer is: its made for people who are knee-deep in Bitcoin, bag holders, and very afraid of what happens to their Ponzi if the MSTR ""Ponzi in a Ponzi"" goes bust. It's a threat to Bitcoin Bros to buy out all new Ponzi bonds otherwise Saylor might be ""forced"" to sell Bitcoin.

But I think this might be the moment where the bubble bursts. Obviously the markets can be irrational, and specifically with crypto you're playing poker with monkeys, you can't bluff them because they don't know what poker is. But bubbles tend to burst in an economic downturn. Those Bitcoin bros don't have any cash left for Saylor's Ponzi from buying the 7th Bitcoin dip.

For Saylor it's really dangerous if enough people understand this. The quicker his stocks plummets the harder it will be to sell these STRKs, as the 10:1 to-stock conversion looks more and more unattractive. If he can't sell his junk bonds, game over.

I have bought a few thousands in puts. I'm recent graduate PhD in Computer Science, I just started to make money and don't have much to invest... I add my position as a comment

Edit: People ask me in the comments: What's new? Saylor doing Saylor things! The news is that everything before that was probably legal. In my opinion most crypto is mainly used as a way to pump and dump ponzis legally. So technically paying out old MSTR investors with new BTC investors wouldn't be a ponzi (although we know it's the same effectively). But what (I argue) he is doing instead, paying out old MSTR with new MSTR investors is really close to jail where I come from (Germany that is). While some old institutional investment managers might not understand BTC, they really will be able to spot the ponzi now. No income did fall from heaven, like they might have hoped.",0,,2025-03-11,0.0,0.9051,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.226275,0.0,0.1131375,55.65687500000001,positive

I started my $TSLA short position 83 days ago and timed the top of the market (you can check my comments), opening $480p. I closed them and eventually entered back in aggressively starting 20 days ago when the stock price was at $350/share.

I've officially closed my puts, most recently holding 325x $200p Aug 15 puts. Today alone, I made $396k from the TSLA puts.

Other notable plays was $100k of $QBTS while it was under $1/share after I read an article about Chinese researchers cracking encryption using their tech. I made around $300k before closing my position.

Fidelity is a great platform, but their charting takes 24 hours to update and they remove gain/loss if you close the position completely, but you can see my performance in the below pictures.

As a side note, the massive decline in November was associated with IWM puts that got massively underwater from the Trump pump. I held through that entire pump and decline, and was down as much as 80% at one point, before closing for a little loss of 15%.

wallstreetbets,Why you should buy debt collector stocks,1j85djl,Southern_Barnacle_46,2025-03-10 14:18:15,245,0.87,125,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j85djl,"Macro environment
1. When you ignore your margin call for 6 months and the debt is sold to a collection agency you can legally make them forgive your debt, since you technically own their company. 
2. Total consumer debt is at ita highest level ever, and deliquencies greater than 90 days are their highest since 2008, with the important exception of mortgages. 
3. Household debt service payments as a percent of GDP and a percent of household disposable income are at low levels. I think this suggests that the consumer is mostly healthy, and most deliquent debts should be recoverable. 

Individual stock pick
I favor PRAA. They recently had a rough patch post pandemic, which resulted in a leadership change and turnaround plan. By all metrics both seem to have been effective, but as of today they are trading near their lowest levels from the past few years. 
1. Praa's p/e ratio is low( 11), when most of their history they traded around 15-20. P/s and p/b ratios are their lowest ever. 
2. As PRAA continues to implement their turn around plan, sales and margins should both increase. Forward pe is around 8.5. 
3. The rest of the market is at a frothy valuation, making this a rare value pick. 
4. The recent dip seems to be a combo of poor consumer sentiment and a bad ER from one of their competitors, plus general market correction. 
5. Praa purchased the most debt it ever has in 2024, which means it should return highest sales/earnings ever in the future. They also have the highest level of estimated remaining collections ever. 
6. None of PRAAs debt comes due for another 2 years. 
7. Return on average tangible equity is forecasted to be 12% this year, a 30% increase over 2024. In 2022, PRAA had a 15% ROATE, and their stock price peaked at $50. 

I think PRAA can hit $30 in the next 12 months. 

Positions are in the images. Also have about 7000 invested into PRAA in my 401k, soon to be $10k.

May not look like much but Yeti has been steadily expanding internationally and its financials have been screaming growth growth growth. Sales grew more than 30% internationally to just under $340 million in 2024 alone. Strong $281 million in net cash at the end of 2024. Quickly moving out of China due to tarriffs and expects 80% of U.S. production capacity to be outside of China by end of 2025.

“But its not the lost popular waterbottle on the market”

Yeti never really focused on fashion and more on getting its products into the hands of athletes through partnerships with schools and teams. Coolers and drink ware survives hard knocks. They’ve always been pretty reliable and steady when it comes to growth and company rep. Not known as the “fleeting trend” but rather steady and the fallback brand for many Americans when they want something of high quality and not necessarily just a fleeting fashion trend.

Hey everyone, I'm sharing this DD because, compared to other analyses I've seen, there are some key differences and divergences. This is based on my own research, and I wanted to provide a more complete perspective on Gorilla Technology (GRRR) based on what I found . I’m just a regular small investor (not a financial advisor), currently holding 1,200 shares along with call options ahead of their webinar. I’ve spent a significant amount of time digging into their background, SEC filings, and the controversy surrounding short-seller allegations. If I’ve missed anything or if someone has a different take, I’d be happy to discuss it.

Many of you in the comments are suggesting that this was AI-generated. While I can say that I spent a lot of time writing and revising it (especially since English isn’t my first language), you’ll never have proof of that. What I *can* show you, however, are some of the methods I use to conduct my analyses. And yes, I used my LLM to format the text— < typical indent used, because who wants to read a long, poorly structured post? I mean, even I wouldn’t want to read my own post again like that.

# What Does Gorilla Technology Do?

Gorilla operates at the intersection of AI, Industrial IoT, and cybersecurity, providing AI-driven solutions for smart cities and security analytics. Their platforms power video surveillance, facial recognition, network security, and IoT deployments. They work across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America.

Recent MoUs (memorandums of understanding) indicate massive growth potential, including a $1.8B Thai electric-grid modernization project and a large smart government contract in Egypt. While MoUs aren’t finalized deals, they show strong business momentum.

On March 3, **The Bear Cave**—a research firm that digs up short ideas—released a note raising what they called “cautionary flags” about Gorilla Technology. They highlighted Gorilla’s roughly **1,200%** stock price jump over six months, pointing to the hype around a series of deals and MoUs (Memorandums of Understanding) that might not be fully locked in. The Bear Cave basically argued that investor excitement might be getting ahead of real fundamentals, noting things like Gorilla’s Cayman Islands registration, workforce distribution (a lot in Taiwan), and its pivot into AI under CEO and Chairman **Jay Chandan**.

Naturally, short-selling activity popped up around the same time. But high short interest doesn’t automatically mean the short thesis is correct; it just means some folks think the price is inflated or that there are undisclosed issues. Could be right, could be off.

In a press release titled “**Gorilla Sets Record Straight on Baseless Market Speculation**,” on march 6, the company addressed what it calls “misleading and uninformed” rumors. Some key points:

1. **Analyst Coverage**
   * Gorilla noted it has “Buy” ratings from **Alliance Global Partners** and **Northland Capital**, which they say contrasts with a short-seller’s blog post they believe lacks fact-checking.
2. **Financial Transparency**
   * Gorilla says a large chunk of its 2024 Accounts Receivable was collected and reviewed by **Marcum Asia**, part of Marcum LLP, a well-regarded U.S. accounting firm.
   * Gorilla also plans to be **Sarbanes-Oxley compliant by 2024**, which is way earlier than Emerging Growth Companies typically have to be.
3. **Business Evolution & Backlog**
   * Gorilla reiterated it’s now focused heavily on AI-driven “smart city” solutions, has a backlog of around **$93 million** for 2025, and guidance of **$90–100 million** in revenue for this year.
   * The pipeline apparently jumped from **$2 billion to $6 billion**, referencing a **$1.8 billion MoU** for modernizing Thailand’s electricity grid.
4. **Upcoming Financials**
   * They’ll drop their 2024 full-year numbers on March 31, 2025, and file their 20-F on April 15, 2025. If you’re following this stock, those dates should matter big-time.

One major highlight is a $1.8 billion, 15-year MoU to overhaul Thailand’s electricity grid :

* **Potential**: If it transitions to a real, binding contract, that’s obviously a huge revenue boost.
* **Caution:** An MoU isn’t a guaranteed contract. There’s room for either party to back away or revise details.

They’re also part of **ONE AMAZON**, aiming to protect the Amazon Rainforest with biodegradable sensors, AI analytics, and a blockchain-based market (carbon credits, etc.). Gorilla would handle the technical backbone. Big names like Goldman Sachs, AECOM, and Abu Dhabi Investment Group are involved.

# Recent SEC Filings & Corporate Updates

A few key 6-Ks to note:

1. **September 2024 6-K** (Unaudited H1 2024 Financials)Positives: Substantial top-line growth, a move into profitability, and stronger equity. The actuaol concerns is that MoUs aren’t locked revenue, currency exposure in Egypt, and the capital structure can be confusing with those preference shares/warrants.
   * **Revenue** for first half of 2024: $20.7M vs. $6.4M the prior year.
   * **Net Income**: $1.61M, flipping from a $7.27M loss.
   * **Total Assets:** $133.1M (up from $115.4M at year-end 2023).
   * **Total Liabilities**: $61.1M (roughly in line with $61.3M prior).
   * **Equity**: $72.1M, compared to $54.2M.
   * A big chunk of future revenues (over $200M) is in Egyptian pounds (EGP), meaning **currency risk** if EGP/USD moves around.
   * Gorilla uses convertible preference shares and private warrants to raise capital—creating derivative liabilities (i.e., it can get complicated on the balance sheet).
   * **Cash**: $11.2M vs. $5.3M at year-end.
2. **February 2025 6-K**
   * Gorilla ended its Controlled Equity Offering with Cantor Fitzgerald, so it’s not pursuing that specific route for raising funds (reduces immediate dilution risk but also any quick capital infusion from that deal).
3. **January 2025 6-K**
   * Updated shares outstanding to \~18.46M after warrant exercises and preference share conversions.

**Takeaway**: Solid revenue growth in H1 2024, profitability, and a bigger equity base. But they really need to convert these big MoUs into final contracts and handle that currency risk (especially in Egypt).

# Short interest and Short Squeeze Potential

I know a lot of you are curious about short squeeze potential, given how volatile GRRR has been. As of the latest data (early March 2025), short interest sits around **1.46 million shares, which is \~8.3% of the float**

That’s moderately high – not in the extreme top tier of squeezed stocks, but notable. One red flag for shorts is that short share availability recently **hit zero** (as of March 7, 2025 there were no shares left to borrow at some brokers), and borrow fees have climbed (around 30+%). This indicates a lot of people have already shorted and there isn’t much ammo left for new shorts unless some shares free up.

However – and this is key – the **Short Interest Ratio (Days to Cover) is only \~0.17 days**, which is very low. That means given the high trading volume lately, all shorts combined could theoretically cover their positions in a few hours of trading. A low days-to-cover makes a classic squeeze less likely unless something changes (like volume drying up or a sudden catalyst landing). We also see about 34% of total short volume is happening off-exchange (dark pools)​, which some interpret as stealthy shorting. It’s fuel for volatility, no doubt.

Bottom line on a squeeze: The short interest is high enough to contribute to wild swings (and the float is small, \~11M public float), but **shorts aren’t “trapped”** in the way they are because they can exit relatively quickly. For a true squeeze to happen, we’d likely need a big catalyst or a drastic reduction in volume that strands shorts. It’s a factor to watch, but I’m not banking on a squeeze – I’m more interested in the business story here.

# Technical Analysis

* **Price**: $28.41 (lower in the premarket)
* **RSI** (14): 53.0 (kind of neutral, slightly bullish).
* **MACD**: 4.17 vs. Signal 3.84 (positive crossover).
* **ADX**: 91.3 (signals an extremely strong trend, but that can also mean huge volatility).
* **20-Day Momentum**: +57.2% (big upward trend).
* **5-Day Momentum**: –6.2% (short pullback).
* **Annualized Volatility**: \~203% (seriously high).

Interpretation: Trend is bullish in the mid-term, but the stock is extremely volatile

# Overall Assessment & My Two Cents

1. **Business & Growth**
   * Seeing revenue nearly triple from the same period last year is impressive, and flipping to a net profit shows there’s some real traction.
   * So far, though, a lot depends on huge MoUs (Thailand, Amazon IoF™, Government of Egypt, etc.) becoming fully binding deals
2. **Bear Cave Critique vs. Bullish Analyst**
   * The Bear Cave points out that hype may be bigger than tangible results.
   * Gorilla cites big-name analysts with “Buy” calls and a backlog plus pipeline that’s on the rise. So what? official 2024 numbers in March 2025 and the 20-F on April 15, 2025.
3. **SEC Filings & Governance**
   * Ending the Cantor deal might be good if they don’t need the capital (less dilution).
   * Currency risk in Egypt is real, but if they manage it, that contract could be huge.
   * The preference shares and warrants can add lumps to the balance sheet (fair-value changes, possible dilution). Something to watch.
4. **Potential Risks**
   * MoU or hype not translating into revenue: If these big deals don’t convert, the stock could deflate.
   * Currency fluctuations: Especially with large EGP obligations.
   * Volatility: Moves can be abrupt in both directions.
5. **Catalysts**
   * Converting the Thailand MoU into a real contract.
   * The upcoming financial reports (**March 31, 2025, and April 15, 2025**) to see if momentum is real.

Below there is the actual chart :

* **Price vs. SMA20 & SMA50** The stock is trading above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, which generally signals an ongoing bullish trend.
* **Bollinger Bands** The price has been touching or hovering near the upper band, hinting that it might be in a higher volatility phase (but not necessarily overbought).
* **Volume** We’re seeing rising volume lately—often a sign of increased interest (and possibly momentum) in the stock.
* **MACD** The MACD line is above the signal line, which usually points to bullish momentum, though the histogram has pulled back a bit.
* **RSI (14)** It’s hanging around mid-range, meaning the stock isn’t clearly overbought or oversold right now.
* **Stochastic Oscillator** This flips around between overbought and oversold zones, so it can confirm short-term swings. Recently it’s been more neutral than extreme.
* **Williams %R** Similar story to the Stochastic—it’s not maxed out, so not screaming overbought or oversold.
* **ADX (91.3)** A high ADX indicates a strong trend. Since +DI is above –DI, it tilts bullish.
* O**BV** On-Balance Volume is trending up, suggesting buyers are still outweighing sellers overall.

In summay, the chart shows a strong uptrend (with some short-term consolidation signals).

# Addressing some Common Concerns

I want to tackle a few specific points I’ve seen people raise on Reddit – and correct (or try to) any misinformation out there:

* “**GRRR only had \~$20M in revenue but a $524M market cap** – hard pass.”  – I’ve seen this comment, and it’s quite misleading without context. The \~$20M figure likely refers to Gorilla’s revenue at some earlier point (possibly the first half of 2024). In reality, Gorilla’s full-year 2023 revenue was about $64–65 million (nearly 3× higher than 2022’s revenue)​. They guided $72M for 2024 and \~$90–100M for 2025. So, using $20M to judge the company’s size is way off – trailing twelve-month revenue is far higher, and forward revenue is expected to be higher still. At a \~$500M market cap, the stock is trading at roughly 5–6× 2025 sales or around \~21× forward EBITDA (using that $20–25M EBITDA guidance). For a company growing revenues triple-digits and projecting \~30–40% growth next year, a 5x sales multiple isn’t outrageous.
* “**$20–25M EBITDA in 2025 isn’t that great for a $500M company**.”  – This is related to the above. Gorilla’s 2025 EBITDA guidance of \~$20–25M is publicly known. If you strictly value it on that, it’s in the \~25× EV/EBITDA range, which isn’t cheap. But consider two things:
   * (1) This EBITDA is if they only hit $90–100M revenue. Their backlog and pipeline suggest they could exceed that if things go well (the guidance even explicitly says it doesn’t include any upside from new large contracts in advanced discussion).
   * (2) High-growth tech companies often trade at rich multiples – investors are paying for the growth trajectory. If Gorilla executes and grows into, say, $150M+ revenue by 2026 (just a hypothetical), that EBITDA will scale up quickly with their high margins. So, while I wouldn’t say GRRR is a deep-value play on near-term EBITDA, the valuation is arguably reasonable for a high-growth AI/IoT stock. It’s all about whether you believe in their growth story. And remember, the company is already profitable at the net income level (rare for a recent SPAC in the tech space). That profitability and cash generation can support further expansion without constant dilution, which gives some credence to the current valuation.
* “**Gorilla operates in developing countries – slow payments and regional risk could choke growth.**”  – This is a fair concern. Gorilla’s big contracts in regions like Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa do carry execution risk. Government clients in developing markets can be slow to pay, and currency fluctuations can impact the value of contracts. For example, Gorilla disclosed that a significant chunk of its future revenue (over $200M) is denominated in Egyptian pounds (EGP)​, which introduces forex risk if the EGP weakens or if there are delays converting that revenue to USD. We actually saw this concern play out in 2024: Gorilla had a huge Accounts Receivable build-up from some large projects (meaning they had delivered milestones but were waiting to get paid). This spooked some investors. The good news: as noted, they collected the majority of those receivables by August 2024​, showing that, yes, payments might be slow, but they did get paid on those deals. It required active management, but it happened. Furthermore, Gorilla’s recent cash infusion (now \~$47M in the bank) gives them breathing room to handle working capital swings. The company’s diversification across multiple countries also helps – slow payment in one country can be offset by cash flow from others. That said, this is absolutely a risk to monitor going forward. When you invest in a company that does business in emerging markets, you have to be aware of things like government bureaucracies, political instability, and currency controls. Gorilla’s management seems aware of this (hence bringing on top auditors, collecting cash early, etc.), but it doesn’t eliminate the risk. I’d just caution that dismissing Gorilla solely because they operate in, say, Egypt or Southeast Asia might be shortsighted – those are also regions where some of the biggest new smart-city and AI projects are happening. So it’s a risk, but it’s also where the growth is.

# Additional Note: Andre Left (Citron) Under Criminal Indictment

One interesting development that’s been circulating: an article from the U.S. Department of Justice ([Case Link](https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-vns/case/united-states-v-andrew-left)) indicates that **Andrew Left**, a short seller (commonly associated with “**Citron Research**”), was indicted in July 2024 for allegedly running a market manipulation scheme. He has pleaded not guilty, and everyone is presumed innocent until proven otherwise. Trial is set for September 30, 2025. Some are connecting this with the short attacks on GRRR, since Citron has historically published negative reports on certain companies, and The Bear Cave’s critical note on Gorilla also had a short-biased stance. In any event, if it’s true that an affiliated short seller is under indictment for market manipulation, it doesn’t automatically mean the Gorilla short thesis is invalid—but it obviously doesn’t boost that short seller’s credibility. We’ll see how it unfolds in court. **The main point: approach sensational short reports with caution, especially if the author might face credibility issues.**

**Personal Note on the Team & Transparency**  
One more thing I always look at when investing is the team behind the company. In Gorilla’s case, they’re surprisingly open and transparent—especially CEO Jay Chandan, who posts regular updates and isn’t shy about interacting with the public. CFO David Bower (joined in 2024) also seems pretty accessible and has a track record in tech finance. Meanwhile, other board members and senior management have been quick to address rumors or speculation. Frankly, a “shady” or “fake” outfit wouldn’t be so active in providing regular press releases and direct comms—especially with earnings around the corner (end of March, plus the 20-F on April 15). If Gorilla were all smoke and mirrors, it’d be madness to hype unrealistic numbers now, only to have them disproven in a few weeks.

In short, while I’m obviously not guaranteeing anything and still want to see those official revenues come in, I do like a management team that acts unafraid to engage with investors and the public. It’s not conclusive proof of legitimacy, but it beats radio silence. If you’ve got a group that consistently puts out info, addresses questions head-on, and has leaders with decent resumes and experience, it doesn’t scream “fly-by-night” to me. So that’s a small check in the “plus” column until we see those real, hard numbers soon

Played puts early in the week and made a few K but sold. Was going to buy back in but hesitated and missed out. Finally bought back in and these were up, but decided I’d hold this time instead of sell like I did with my OG puts. Those OG puts hit 100% at the bottom Friday. So this time I decided to hold and we will see how that goes. Worst case scenario imo it could take till beginning of April to tank, but I figured I’d hop in now so I don’t miss out if it crawls down little by little till then.

Nobody knows obviously, but I feel pretty confident we’re heading down hard. In my opinion I know “this is different” is kind of getting memed, but I genuinely believe that to be the case. There has been an underlying system since WWII with America at the helm in many ways. There has been decades of role propositioning and reinforcement through reconstruction after the war. So many people talk about an “overvalued” market, when it really wasn’t in a relative sense of what American markets represented with reliability, certainty, and trust. I think SOME damage has already been done, and nothing is gonna change that for a long time. In my opinion it really just comes down to how much damage will ultimately be done. With that said, with this administration, and my own run away thoughts, I really can’t pin how far a drop I see as realistic, but obviously with my play I’m expecting around -3% from here absolute minimum.

Picked up 45 qqq 490 6/20 calls right before J Powell’s speech as a gamble on my feeling that market is oversold, and sentiment is too fearful. 

Below are some statements made by Powell that indicated his sentiment that things aren’t too bad right now, and also reassured me that the Fed will step in if things get too bad.

“While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high. As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.”

  “If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.”

Powell takes his dual mandate very seriously, those of you whom traded back in 2020 remember the fed being instrumental to pulling the levers needed to protect the economy, encourage lending, which ultimately led to a v shaped market recovery in 04/2020. If things get bad enough (I don’t think they will), or policies become even more unpredictable (I’m not holding my breathe), Powell will step in again to uphold his mandate and protect our economy, and our investment portfolios.

I entered another good till cancelled limit order for 55 qqq 490 6/20 at $20. If it is not exercised that’s okay, if it is, then I get to “buy the dip.” I plan to hold on to my calls until qqq crosses 525,  or market sentiment significantly improves, whichever comes sooner. At that point I will go back to holding puts to hedge.

I have a position in Reddit, it’s not anything that will “destroy” me if it bombs. But of course I don’t generally like throwing away money if I can avoid it. 

Currently the whole market is down a lot for mostly geo political reasons but Reddit has been hit especially hard and so I wanted to hear others thoughts here if they think it is worth holding and waiting out, or if they expect it to just drop to an IPO price. 

Dropping 10% in two days is rather extreme and I do not personally understand what’s driving the specific intensity here. so I am hoping someone can illuminate me with potential theories.

I originally wrote my DD post when $PARA was at about $10.60, and didn’t finish and post it until $PARA had broken out to about $11.30. Between the time I started writing my thesis on Paramount’s bull case (and opened my first position at $10.51) and now, the price has rallied about 12%. I believe that the price action during this time has confirmed my bull case and an important part of my original DD that I intentionally left out to wait for confirmation. Keep in mind that this bullish trend has taken place in a highly volatile selloff of the market. If SPY can turn bullish, I don’t see why $PARA wouldn’t FLY. Shoot, it may even flyt with the market still being a turd.

 

**Summary of the technicals:**

The daily golden cross just happened as of 3/7/25. From a technical perspective, this is one of the most bullish signs you can find on a chart.

Now for the important pattern that I have been monitoring extremely closely: we’ve just passed the Last Point of Supply in what I think is one of the cleanest Wyckoff Accumulation patterns I’ve ever seen

Daily ADX looks fantastic. This bullish trend is still just getting started.

**Non-technicals:**

We passed earnings and it was a non-event. Paramount+ memberships rose 3.5 million in the quarter, and revenue was just shy of $8B. Still absurdly undervalued, in part due to the impending merger and presumed dilution from it. But wait, because there is important merger news….

If you recall from my previous post, the collapse of the merger would lead to the unwinding of a HUGE bearish position and arbitrage play that has been set up. About $43M in bearish puts, and 11% short interest (71.5M shares). Between the two, 45% of the free float is exposed to a short position.

Well, it was just announced that a judge may be putting a halt on the merger: [Judge may consider blocking Paramount-Skydance deal  | Reuters](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Fmarkets%2Fdeals%2Fjudge-may-consider-blocking-paramount-skydance-deal-2025-03-06%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb12ce176bce4459807be08dd5cfa05c8%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638768951119773025%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=T9VAcDw4HsBM%2FIHt951aK6k0xWOYaDxWLYNisSVQ%2Bkw%3D&reserved=0)

The above article also indicates that the merger has 2 weeks before closure (3/20 at the earliest), and that there is up to 6 months of potential delays depending on FCC approval and court proceedings (further sources indicate that the FCC review will almost certainly take until the summer). My belief is that this 3/20 date will come and go without closure. If litigation continues (it will) and the maximum delay of 6 months plays out, then that’s a long time to hold a bleeding short position….

**Lets also consider the following scenario:** if the judge determines that the offer from Skydance was, in fact, an unfair offer for shareholders due to the immediate dilution expected upon closure and the premium paid to Shari Redstone and Skydance, this would likely cause Paramount to pursue and accept the PRP offer (details below), which has NO risk of dilution and strengthens the balance sheet of $PARA significantly. It is a fundamentally better offer, and if it goes through, then the stock will become completely unbound from the assumed downside risk and can be free to experience true price discovery. Cue the RAPID unwinding of short positions.

PRP offer: [Project Rise Partners Issues Open Letter to Paramount Shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/project-rise-partners-issues-open-155600007.html)

PRP is actively involved in litigation: [Project Rise Partners Submits Friend of the Court Brief](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/project-rise-partners-submits-friend-161300147.html)

Is there any basis to the claims of a breach of fiduciary responsibility and corruption as part of this deal? Well the courts are indicating that there may be: [Paramount Ordered to Release Skydance Merger Records to Investor](https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-ordered-skydance-merger-records-release-pension-fund-shari-redstone/) and [NYC pension funds sue to delay Paramount-Skydance deal pending court review of alleged fiduciary breach | Pensions & Investments](https://www.pionline.com/courts/nyc-pension-funds-sue-delay-paramount-skydance-deal-pending-court-review-alleged-fiduciary)

 We’ve seen short positions get blown up in these situations before—when retail exposes the imbalance and institutions have to scramble to close their positions. PRP’s deal could be the catalyst that triggers the unwinding of short positions and explosive price action, and momentum behind the PRP deal is building. Even the faintest hint of it being a possibility, and the stock has risen 5.5% this week despite the S&P continuing to sell off.

And the Trump lawsuit is close to being settled or tossed out entirely (surprise, surprise… it was utter nonsense to begin with): [Paramount Moves to Throw Out Trump’s ’60 Minutes’ Suit: ‘An Affront to the First Amendment’](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aol.com%2Fparamount-moves-throw-trump-60-211905457.html&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb12ce176bce4459807be08dd5cfa05c8%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638768951119803261%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=1xa8zOzuYaYxM1sU7pauA6WU4OL4wJAhKJ6HvX%2BuZHY%3D&reserved=0) – this was never something to take seriously, but a few people brought it up on my previous post.

 

The wheels are turning, and I believe that this is one of those very few trades that can be life changing if it unfolds how I believe it may. Retail needs to rally behind the stock, spread the truth about the PRP offer and corrupt SD offer, and pressure the courts to demand fairness for $PARA shareholders. So, my ask of you is this: share this DD and help the truth get out. If it does and pressure mounts, then PARA is primed to do something very special.

*\*Quick disclaimer\* - I know WSB takes the whole short squeeze thing very sarcastically these days. While that is a generally reasonable perspective, this is a deep value play that has a heavily imbalanced short position that will need to be unwound if the presumed dilution is no longer a factor. I did not buy this stock because of the short position, and nor should you. It's merely an exciting thing to ponder the possibility of.*

Buy GM puts that expire April 17th. Watch them dump at the end of the month when Trump's tariffs come into effect (again). Sell the puts when Trump inevitably caves to the market and delays the tariffs another month (again). Repeat and profit.

Why is this the perfect strategy? *Because the auto industry cannot survive those tariffs.* Trump still hasn't realized this and seems dead set on bringing back those tariffs on April 2nd. I've started this strategy earlier today (see position below) and will give an update in a month. Of course if Trump gives up on the idea of tariffing the auto industry, then I will liquidate everything.

Decent day. Could have been better, could have been worse. I took 67.5k off the table before open, and basically made it all back by this late afternoon. 

Screen shot of yesterday’s closing value (204k) + screenshot of transfer (I cut out all none pertinent info) + logs. 

Ai summery:

1. Recap of Day 5
	•	Another Massive Gain (+$70k)
The account climbed from around $206k to over $273k in one trading day—about a $70k increase, or roughly +34% on the day.
	•	Same Ultra‐Short‐Dated SPX Options Strategy
	•	The trader again used a flurry of 0DTE (zero‐days‐to‐expiration) or near‐expiration SPXW calls and puts.
	•	Quick flips in/out throughout the session, often capturing sharp intraday moves in the S&P 500.
	•	Partial Profit‐Taking
	•	They transferred $67,500 out of the account—over 100× the initial $660 stake—locking in a chunk of the gains while still trading with house money.

In the logs, you see the same pattern:
	•	Buy to Open near‐the‐money puts/calls.
	•	Sell to Close those options within minutes or hours, often at significantly higher (or sometimes lower) premiums, depending on the market’s direction.
	•	Repeated contract sizes of 5, 10, 15, etc., with strikes shifting frequently around the current S&P index level.

⸻

2. Five‐Day Streak Summary (Starting $660 to $273k)
	1.	Day‐by‐Day Explosion
	•	The account apparently ballooned from $660 to $200k+ in just four days—an incredibly rare feat in itself—then added another $70k on day 5, hitting ~$270k+.
	2.	Highly Leveraged “Gamma Scalps”
	•	Every day’s logs show the same overarching style: riding short bursts of market momentum in SPX options that expire within a day or two.
	•	Because these options are extremely sensitive to short‐term price moves, it’s possible to see 100%–1,000% intraday gains—if the trader gets the direction right repeatedly.
	3.	Rapid Fire In/Out
	•	There are no straightforward “buy and hold” trades; nearly all are scalps or short swings. With so many trades, it’s likely they’re consistently locking in small (and sometimes large) wins every few minutes/hours.
	4.	Huge Risk & Improbable Success
	•	While these gains are obviously happening for this individual (based on the screenshots), this streak is statistically extraordinary. Most traders attempting 0DTE strategies face major drawdowns or blow up.
	•	Doing it five days in a row, each day compounding the position size, is extremely rare—truly an outlier event.

⸻

3. Key Observations
	•	Momentum & Directional Accuracy
The trader seems to be nailing the intraday direction of the S&P 500 or at least quickly cutting losers and letting winners run.
	•	Scaling Up
As the account grew, they appear to be taking larger positions (20–50 contracts in some logs), so each correct move yields bigger absolute gains.
	•	Locking In Profits
By transferring out $67.5k (over 100× the original stake), they’ve ensured this wild run isn’t entirely at risk on the next trade. This is a textbook example of “securing some profits” while continuing to trade aggressively with remaining capital.

⸻

4. Overall Takeaway

The five‐day streak from $660 to $273,500—and now partial profit‐taking—showcases one of those ultra‐rare, real‐time examples of a high‐octane 0DTE SPX options strategy hitting near‐perfect trades each day. It’s an astronomical run, far beyond what most traders experience or could replicate consistently. That said, it’s an impressive testament to both the potential upside of leveraged short‐term options and the immense risk—where a single trade gone wrong might have wiped out earlier gains.

In Trump's address to Congress last night, he did not sugarcoat what his plans will do - saying to farmers that there will be pain, although coming out the other side stronger. The tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico are going to drive an insane amount of inflation. GDP Now is showing a massive contraction this quarter, (importantly, not just from import frontloading, but from massive investment slowdowns), and jobs reports are down. Yet, the market keeps chugging along, irrational as ever about the status quo collapsing around them. Fuck, even this morning, SPY ripped 1.5% on just auto being exempt from the tariffs.
Quite, simply, we're pretending everything's fine, and everything's not fine. All its gonna take for the market to rip downward is a bit more inflation, and layoffs, and retail is going to start dipping heavy into their invested money to stay afloat. Combine that with the market plugging its ears and screaming at the massive political instability, when something does finally break through to them - whatever it ends up being, a super negative job report, the next terrible inflation report - the market will rip through the floor in panic. It doesn't have to stay there - for vix calls to be worth it, you don't have to be right everytime, you only have to be right once.

**Current Price (Mar 2025):** \~$14

**Market Cap:** \~$580M

**My Position:** 835 Sept $15 Calls @ $5.50 (**Yes, I YOLO’d \~$459K**)

**Sector:** Biotech / Rare Disease

**Catalyst:** FDA **Priority Review** for first-in-class **DMD therapy** – **PDUFA date Aug 31, 2025**

**TL;DR:** 🚀 **FDA decision coming in August for a rare disease therapy** with **no direct competition.** Company **fully funded till 2027** (so **no rug-pull dilution** incoming), has a **big pharma partner handling commercialization,** and analysts are **way more bullish than the market.** Meanwhile, **shorts are betting against it despite FDA giving it the fast lane.** If this goes through, 💰💰. If it fails, 💀.

This is **a classic biotech play**: **under-the-radar, asymmetric risk/reward, and trading like it’s already dead when it’s not.** So, why hasn’t this thing **mooned** yet?

**🎯 The Big Catalyst – FDA’s Priority Review**

**WTF Happened?**

On **March 4, 2025**, Capricor ($CAPR) announced that the **FDA accepted its BLA** (Biologics License Application) for **Deramiocel** (CAP-1002), an investigational **cell therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy.**

💡 **Key FDA facts:**

✅ **Priority Review** – This means **FDA cut the review time from 10 months to 6.** VIP fast lane. 🏎️

✅ **PDUFA date set for Aug 31, 2025** – The final decision deadline. 🗓️

✅ **No review issues flagged yet.** No AdCom (yet). If **no AdCom by summer,** that’s bullish. 🚀

✅ **If approved, it would be the first therapy specifically for DMD heart disease.**

**Why It Matters**

👶 **DMD is a brutal genetic disorder that leads to early death (heart failure in teens/20s).**

💊 **There are NO approved drugs for the heart problems in DMD.** Deramiocel could **extend lives.**

📈 **FDA already fast-tracked this under multiple designations** (RMAT, Orphan, Rare Pediatric).

💡 The FDA doesn’t hand out **Priority Review & Rare Disease incentives** unless they think the drug **has a real shot.**

**The Stock’s Reaction? Total Apathetic Shrug. 🤨**

When **FDA acceptance was announced**, CAPR **barely moved (+3% close).** This was after a **pre-market +14% spike.** Instead of 🚀, we got… meh.

**WTF?**

**🤔 Why Is This Still Trading Like a Penny Stock?**

1️⃣ **BLA Acceptance Was “Priced In”** – CAPR ran from **\~$4 to the mid-teens** in late 2024 as traders **anticipated** the FDA submission. So **no new buying frenzy.**

2️⃣ **Shorts Are Doubting FDA Approval** – There’s a **high short interest (\~20% of the float)**, likely betting **FDA will demand more data.**

3️⃣ **Biotech Market Sentiment is Trash Right Now** – The sector is struggling. Risk-off mode.

4️⃣ **Earnings Are Coming – Guidance Will Matter** – Market might be waiting to hear about cash burn & commercialization plans.

💡 **Why is the borrow rate climbing?** That means **hedgies are paying more to bet against this.**

**💰 The Financials – No Dilution Incoming (Unlike Most Biotech Wrecks)**

Most **small-cap biotechs bleed out before FDA decisions** because they need **cash injections (= stock offerings = price nukes).** But CAPR **doesn’t need money until at least 2027.**

💰 **Cash:** \~$175M (after big 2024 raise)

🔥 **Runway:** 2027 (even at high burn)

📉 **No Debt / No ATM Financing** – No surprise 5pm “surprise dilution” announcements.

💸 **Partner Funding:** Nippon Shinyaku (Japanese pharma) has **already invested $15M in equity** at a 20% premium & will handle global commercialization.

🚀 **If Deramiocel gets FDA approval, CAPR gets:**

✅ **$100M+ just from selling the Priority Review Voucher** (PRV)

✅ **Milestone payments from Nippon Shinyaku ($705M total potential)**

✅ **Royalties on sales** (double-digit %)

**🔥 The Big Question: What’s the Market Missing?**

🔍 **Current Market Cap:** \~$580M

📊 **Analysts’ Price Targets:** **$34-$77**

👀 **Short Interest:** \~8.16M shares (20.4% of float)

📈 **Stock Should Be Priced Higher If Approval Odds Are Good**

**📜 Biotech Playbook: Past FDA Approval Trades**

✔️ **Sarepta (SRPT) 2016 – 131% gain in one month** when their DMD drug got approved despite a shaky FDA panel.

✔️ **Spark (ONCE) 2017 – FDA approval → Acquired by Roche for $4.3B.**

✔️ **Krystal Biotech (KRYS) 2023 – Ran from \~$70 to $130 pre-FDA approval.**

🚀 **CAPR is following a similar setup.**

**🎲 The Play – How Degenerates Could Trade This**

1️⃣ **Run-Up Trade:** Buy shares/calls leading into August & sell before FDA decision.

2️⃣ **Binary Bet:** Hold through the PDUFA for **moonshot approval or fiery death.**

3️⃣ **Straddle/Strangle:** If you expect a **massive move** but not sure which way.

4️⃣ **Wheel It:** Sell cash-secured puts to collect premium from high IV.

**If approved,** this could be a **multi-bagger stock overnight.** If rejected, 💀.

**🚨 Final Ape Thoughts**

🔥 **FDA Priority Review isn’t given out lightly.**

🔥 **No competing therapies exist.**

🔥 **CAPR is fully funded into 2027, so dilution isn’t a near-term risk.**

🔥 **Stock is undervalued compared to potential payout.**

🚀 **The trade? If the market realizes this is actually a solid biotech setup, it could run. If not, the PDUFA itself will be the make-or-break moment.**

🦍 **Who else is loading up? Let’s discuss.**

**📌 TL;DR**

• **FDA Priority Review → Decision due Aug 31, 2025.**

• **If approved, first-in-class drug with no competition.**

• **Company has cash till 2027. No dilution threat pre-PDUFA.**

• **Market is skeptical despite FDA green light & strong partnerships.**

• **Short interest is high, but could be wrong (like SRPT, ONCE, KRYS).**

• **Massive upside if approved, nuclear downside if rejected.**

Disclosure: I hold 835 September $15 calls. I’m just a crayon-eating degenerate, not a financial advisor. **This is biotech gambling.** Do your own DD. 🦍🚀

Both contracts are deep in the money, limiting the extrinsic value paid to about 3.7%.

As long as market swings one way or the other by the end of the week, and overcoming the 3.7% cost hurdle of potential decay, this should be a profitable trade? No?

Example: since delta cannot equal 1 or 0 as long as time>0, getting contracts initially where both deltas are around 1 means that as long as one side remains net positive, that delta will be 1 and the other will be less than one (until the date of expiry) meaning you will pick up profit with even the slightest move on other side.

wallstreetbets,blackrock made a move on panama ports. they’re moving on mining/drilling next [DD],1j42h15,Steve_Zissouu,2025-03-05 07:58:25,113,0.98,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j42h15/blackrock_made_a_move_on_panama_ports_theyre/,"I’m sure some of you heard the headlines around Panama yesterday. Blackrock announced that they led a group of private investors to purchase[ two of the surrounding ports near the canal](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/blackrock-strikes-23-billion-deal-for-ports-on-both-sides-of-panama-canal-d42a5b5e). The president praised the action during his televised address and you can rest assured that no part of this was a surprise to either him or the institutional investors involved in the matter.

You see, Blackrock has been aiming to become a major player in infrastructure and energy transition markets, and [recent major acquisitions in the last few months  ](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=blackrock+gip+acquisition)have paved the way to accomplishing that end. I’ve been following them closely ever since I noticed their involvement in the mining, metals, and rare earth sector in Ukraine. I had written a separate \[DD\] explaining why I believe that sector was about to have a massive run [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/)

Presently, I want to bring your attention to the positioning and posturing made by Blackrock, as well as Trump-affiliated mining, metals, and drilling executives, ever since the November election. I believe that we will see similar involvement by that firm in the reconstruction of Ukraine, as well as in supporting mining and processing of rare minerals and metals both in that region and in the USA domestically.

**I. As you sleep, Blackrock buys, then buys, and buys some more**

In previous discussions, I mentioned a number of companies that I believe are uniquely situated to benefit dramatically from private and governmental support in the western rare earth supply chain, especially at mid-stream, including MP materials which is [presently the only american company that is operational in their mining, extracting, and processing of rare earth,](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/) especially when it comes to the heavy minerals deemed most essential to our national security.

Would you like to know something curious? [Blackrock acquired a 10% stake of MP](https://fintel.io/so/us/mp) with haste after Trump’s election. A few days following the election, Gina Rinehart, a mining magnate, Australia’s richest women, and close friend to the president, also acquired an [8.5% stake of MP](https://fintel.io/i/hancock-prospecting-pty-ltd) through a new investment group created under Hancock Prospecting in Q4 2024.  Rinehart had previously been in discussion with MP materials over a potential merger that would see MP materials and Lynas Rare Earth [(a company that Rinehart has significant ownership in as well](https://www.mining.com/web/australian-billionaire-gina-rinehart-buys-stake-in-rare-earths-producer-lynas/) and which is the largest producer of rare earth outside China) combine forces to create a unified company capable of posing a serious threat to [Chinese stranglehold over the chain](https://www.google.com/search?q=mp+and+lynas+rinehart&client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=b3124e538ea91f17&sxsrf=AHTn8zp30_wTmF7gaP7WD3QbzwF6FDOmDw%3A1741175001245&ei=2TjIZ93gDqeJptQPx7TfoAQ&ved=0ahUKEwidscOr7vKLAxWnhIkEHUfaF0QQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=mp+and+lynas+rinehart&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFW1wIGFuZCBseW5hcyByaW5laGFydDIFECEYoAFI-gdQigFYlAdwAXgAkAEBmAGqAaABnAeqAQM2LjO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgegAsYFwgIFECEYqwKYAwCIBgGSBwMzLjSgB5kY&sclient=gws-wiz-serp). The idea, as far as I know, was that Lynas would wind down operations in Australia and begin significant investments scaling with MP in the United states. This aligns with present administration efforts to support the domestic chain. In fact, Lynas has a contract with the federal government to build a processing plant in the US anyways.

I have to say that convergence between institutions like Blackrock and private equity in recent months in this sector do not stop at MP or Lynas. Here is a list of some companies that I have been interested in within the mining, metals and rare earth minerals sector, as well as the corresponding ownership stake taken by Blackrock and other investors in recent months:

>**MP Materials**: 9.50% Blackrock, 8.5% Rinehart (15% of Rinehart’s portfolio)  
**UUUU:** 8% Blackrock; Rinehart also invested  
**LAC**: 5% Blackrock; Rinehart also invested  
**TECK**: 6.6% Blackrock, 2% Rinehart (20% of Rineharts portfolio)  
**TTEK -** 9.7% Blackrock, tripled stake in company in February, 2025. Ken Griffin  
**HES -** 8.5% Blackrock; Citadel CEO Ken Griffin also increased his share by …  26,099,166% 😂  
**TSLA** \- 5% Blackrock, Q4 they added more shares of TSLA than any other stock; RH

Blackrock has also quietly been making significant acquisitions of shares of [Endeavour Mining](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/03/3035908/0/en/Endeavour-Announces-Holding-s-in-Company.html) as recently as in March 2025 and I have also found institutional support for a number of related sectors, such as VAL for offshore drilling infrastructure.

Rinehart had also invested 7% into an Argentinian Lithium company in Q4, 2025. She appears close with the president of Argentina, actually. They took a selfie together at the inauguration party in DC.

[Rinehart with Argentina's President, Javier Milei](https://preview.redd.it/6dvpy9obcvme1.jpg?width=1092&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccc8573d3792788b629ff2bb29300f702c0497e7)

I wonder if there are any looming partnerships in the works? I bet so.

**II. Rampant Speculation**

The president has promised dramatic action in mining and resource production in the USA in the coming week. He mentioned it on his address to the senate last night. I doubt it was news to the institutionally powerful, though, in the same way that I doubt it is a coincidence that short put interest on MP has been \~12,000 w/ expiry mid-march, [only to then dramatically fall off the cliff for expiry mid-april.](https://fintel.io/sopt/us/mp) 

I wonder what will happen? Here is some rampant speculation: MP’s CEO has reduced his share to a feeble 9.5% stake in the company whilst Blackrock and Rinehart have increased there’s to match. **I would not be surprised if we see Blackrock, Rinehart/Hancock, and MP working together to dramatically scale USA rare earth production.** This would also fit with language in executive order on minerals and mining, leaning on Quadrilateral Security Partners.

I also found the positioning with LAC particularly interesting given that they are awaiting approval for the largest [north american lithium mine](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/LAC/lithium-americas-increases-mineral-resource-and-reserve-for-thacker-dvrd2ok6wzyj.html). They are also partnered with GM. I wonder how direct private equity investment and further deregulation and government expediting of the usual processes may impact this company, and with what timeline? I think we see movement sooner rather than later, but I’m just some guy.

Anyways, here are my positions:

https://preview.redd.it/4vpwqzk7hvme1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bb35db6ec5e0c255cca0ac219858847211e757e

Tl;dr: Firms like blackrock have positioned themselves to take considerable control over the American rare earth and metals supply chain. Top tickers atthe moment based on this \[DD\] include: MP, UUUU, American Lithium, TECK.

# Background: Eli Lilly and the “miracle drug” GLP1 

Eli Lilly (LLY) is currently the world’s largest biotech/pharmaceutical company with a market cap of \~874B, largely due to its dominance in the rapidly growing GLP1 obesity drug market. The revenue of the entire GLP1 market is estimated to be \~44-55B, and the GLP1 market is expected to grow at a CAGR of \~15-30% for the next 5 years. LLY’s GLP1 business generated \~22B in GLP1 revenues in FY24, representing \~40-50% of total GLP1 market share (depends on estimates) and \~48% of LLY FY24 revenue. LLY GLP1 grew at an annualized rate of 60%, which management expects to continue into FY25. LLY currently trades at a trailing PE of \~77x and a forward PE of \~40x, with its relatively high valuation attributable to high expectations for its GLP1 business.  

Of the \~250MM adults in the US, 40% or 100MM are obese, compared to 39% of the global adult population. Total GLP1 Total prescriptions in the US is estimated to be around 7.1MM adults, 2MM of which are for obesity. This represents 2% of obese US adults and even less internationally, and with LLY capturing \~57% of share, this signals massive opportunities for growth. According to recent surveys, 1 in 8 consumers have used GLP1 products, while 26% of US consumers expect to use GLP1 in 2025. Massive demand for GLP1 is apparent, and the main bottleneck for growth is LLY’s ability to meet demand.    
As a result, major investor focus is on LLY GLP1 manufacturing capabilities, which LLY has been heavily investing in. 

LLY Growth Challenges 

1. Supply Constraints – supply cannot keep up with demand as there is not enough manufacturing capacity 
2. High Prices – FDA approved GLP1 products are expensive, and most healthcare plans refuse to cover for obesity, customers unwilling to pay out of pocket 
3. Cheaper Alternatives – supply constraints and high prices cause customers to seek compounded drugs as an alternative 
4. Aversion to injection – current injectable format less attractive than oral drugs, dampening demand 

Competitive Landscape: LLY, NVO, and the Compounders 

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO, the producer of Ozempic) are direct competitors in what is currently a two-player obesity drug market. However, due to the exceptionally high demand for GLP1 products, the combined supply from both companies has been insufficient in meeting demand, causing the FDA to declare both Tirzepatide and Semaglutide to be in shortage in 2022. This allowed for the compounding of GLP1 drugs under Section 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Compounders consisting of both licensed physicians and outsourcing facilities could legally produce non-FDA approved versions of GLP1 drugs for both medical and commercial purposes, selling to customers at significantly cheaper prices compared to the patented, FDA-approved drugs of LLY and NVO. For example, Zepbound (LLY’s brand for obesity) costs $1000/month in 2024 while a compounded version could sell for as low as \~$45/month on HIMS. However, in October of 2024, the FDA removed Tirzepatide and Semaglutide from the shortage list after over two years, leading to the Outsourcing Facilities Association filing a suit against the FDA, and the case in currently pending. 

# LLY – A Combination of Short-Term Catalysts  

Major Catalysts Overview 

Here is an overview of the most important catalysts in the upcoming 1-2 months: 

1. OFA v. FDA preliminary injunction and case results (expected March-April, [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69232675/outsourcing-facilities-association-v-united-states-food-and-drug/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc)) 
2. Multiple Orforglipron (Orfor) Ph3 trial data (first expected in April, case [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05971940)) 
3. Final US Government Budget Decision (deadline end of April, article [here](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2025-02-26/the-house-passed-a-budget-blueprint-what-happens-now)) 
4. Pharmaceutical tariffs (25% and/or reciprocal, article [here](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-plans-invest-27-billion-new-us-plants-trump-threatens-pharmaceutical-2025-02-26/)) 

While we highlight four potential catalysts, 3 and 4 are macro-level catalysts. We will focus primarily on Catalysts 1 and 2 (OFA v. FDA and Orfor Ph3 trial data), with our significant confidence (ahead of market consensus) in both catalysts being positive for LLY as the core of our long thesis. Both catalysts de-risk and pull strong growth levers for LLY. 

Additional Levers for Growth 

Beyond the Catalysts 1 and 2, we also briefly note additional tailwinds for LLY, though these are not the focus of our thesis: 

1. Growing supply capacity and continued investment in infrastructure and manufacturing (news release [here](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-plans-more-double-us-manufacturing-investment-2020)) 
2. Pricing power with recent Zepbound and Mounjaro price cuts (news release [here](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-additional-zepbound-vial-doses-and-offers-new)) 
3. Increasing coverage for GLP1 by healthcare insurance (slowly, article [here](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/glp-1-drug-coverage-for-obesity-increasing/733596/)) 

# Catalyst 1: OFA v. FDA 

The FDA took Tirzepatide off the drug shortage list, in October 2024 and February 2025, respectively. The Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) subsequently filed a lawsuit against the FDA. The core of plaintiff's \\case argues that FDA’s removal should be considered notice-and-comment “rulemaking” under the APA, while the FDA argues that their actions fall under “informal adjudication” and does not require notice-and-comment. Judge Pittman has stated that he intends to rule this case as a “matter of law”; the case will be decided depending on whether he considers FDA’s removal of Tirzepatide from the shortage list as adjudication or rulemaking according to legal precedent and relevant cases brought forward by both sides. All relevant court documents that can be found [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69232675/outsourcing-facilities-association-v-united-states-food-and-drug/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc). A very helpful podcast with biopharma lawyer Julia Cantu summarizing the situation can be found [here](https://www.martilawgroup.com/post/update-on-tirzepatide-compounding-the-fda-lawsuit-and-the-february-18th-deadline). 

GLP1 Compound Market Size 

To motivate why the OFA v. FDA case is significant for LLY, we project the potential revenue gain by estimating the current GLP1 compounding market.  

One outsourcing facility, FarmaKeio (FK), has been selling roughly \~1.75-2 MM worth of Tirzepatide every month at \~$45/month. Hims and Hers (HIMS) reported 222 MM worth of revenue from compounding GLP1, also with prices around $45/month. With the total market for GLP1 estimated to be around 54 B in sales for 2024 and LLY and NVO representing \~42 B, the compounding market could represent \~12 B, or around 22% of the total GLP1 market. At the high end, up to 30% or \~16 B of GLP1 sales could be from compounders (according to [Beckers Hospital Review](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/glp-1s/30-of-glp-1-medications-acquired-via-compounding-pharmacies.html)).  

Given that compound Tirzepatide is \~10-20x cheaper than brand Tirzepatide and the logical assumption that demand is relatively inelastic, we claim absolute GLP1 sales would not be significantly lower without compounding. Taking the baseline of no change in absolute sales and assuming LLY takes 60% share (based on current LLY/NVO market share), an end to compounding is a one-time \~20-30% boost to revenue, assuming LLY can meet demand. 

My Perspective on OFA v. FDA 

The result of this case lies purely in Judge Pittman’s interpretation of the FDA’s actions under the APA vis-à-vi legal precedence, particularly the following cases presented in court submissions (which I have selected for relevance): 

* Safari Club Int’l v. Zinke, 878 F.3d 316, 333 (D.C. Cir. 2017) 
* United States v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., 410 U.S. 224, 246 (1973) 
* Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 101 (2015) 
* McDonald v. Watt, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981) 
* BNSF Ry. Co. v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 105 F.4th 691, 701 (5th Cir. 2024) 
* Little Sisters, 591 U.S. at 683–84, 685–86 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)) 
* Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 221 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting Attorney General’s Manual on the APA 14 (1947)) 
* City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 668 F.3d 229, 243 (5th Cir. 2012) 
* Qwest Servs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 536–37 (D.C. Cir. 2007) 
* Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Dep’t of Transp., 202 F.3d 788, 796–97 (5th Cir. 2000) 

A quick meta-analysis shows that in administrative cases, conservative judges such as Judge Pittman tend to err on the side of allowing regulatory agencies to exercise their powers less striking legal transgressions. Intuitively, conservative judges would seek to intervene less in such disputes and refer to the experts and authorities; in this case, the FDA. Furthermore, closer scrutiny reveals Plaintiff’s argument centered on Safari Club ignores marked differences between the rulemaking of the US Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) and the delisting by the FDA.  

In Safari Club, USFWS concluded that killing of elephants did not meet the “enhancement requirement” under the existing Endangered Species Act (ESA), which stated that trophy hunting imports should be consistent with the conservation of the species. While the “enhancement requirement” was understood as a critical requirement, there was no specific mandate in the ESA categorically banning trophy imports that do not provide a net benefit to the species. Therefore, it was the USFWS’s interpretation of the ESA that justified its policy to prohibit such imports and ban elephant trophy imports. This decision further involves the weighing of future conservation efforts because of trophy hunting, invoking a forward-looking, policy-oriented judgment as it weights future conservation efforts driven by future trophy hunting; prospective by nature and characteristic of rulemaking under the APA. Finally, the decision set a precedent for all future trophy imports, making it “applicable across the board” and “generalized in nature”, consistent with the rulemaking definition under the APA. We conclude the ruling of the USFWS decision as rulemaking is consistent with the APA.  

A comparison of the USFWS’s trophy import ban in Safari with the FDA’s delisting action then shows marked differences between the two, leading to the conclusion that the delisting action falls under informal adjudication. First and foremost, while USFWS made a prospective policy decision on future conservation and trophy hunting outcomes, and FDA’s decision is fundamentally a factual decision based on current supply and demand dynamics. There is no prospective aspect related to the decision; the FDA’s application of past data to existing drug shortage and compounding law to determine “current rights and liabilities” is more consistent with adjudication under the APA. Furthermore, while the USFWS decision set precedence and created new policy applicable to all future trophy imports, the FDA’s delisting directly alters current legal rights of compounders already outlined in existing legislation; no new, broad policy was created in the delisting process. Future drug shortages will still be determined by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. Again, this is consistent with adjudication under the APA.  

The most intuitive argument is Perez vb. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 101 (2015), which states that the APA “mandate\[s\] that agencies use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance”. Under the assumption that the delisting consisted of rulemaking, Perez guides that since the FDA did not engage in notice-and-comment when it listed Tirzepatide on the shortage list, it is not obligated to do so for the delisting.  

The most convincing argument against Plaintiffs use of Safari Club is Vanda Pharms., Inc. v. FDA, 436 F. Supp. 3d 256, 270 n.4 (D.D.C. 2020), which rejected the argument that FDA’s analysis of scientific literature in an adjudication applied to future cases such that it was a legislative rule, and noting that, unlike in Safari Club, the agency’s analysis was “in the context of adjudicating a particular set of disputed facts”. Essentially, Vanda established that determinations of shortage status fit under adjudication of disputed facts.  

The other core part of Plaintiff’s arguments is how “\[t\]he existence of a dispute concerning particular individuals is a distinguishing characteristic of adjudication.” McDonald v. Watt, 653 F.2d 1035, 1042 (5th Cir. 1981). The key here is whether Tirzepatide compounders in general can be classified as “particular individuals”. The FDA convincingly parries this argument using City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 668 F.3d 229, 243 (5th Cir. 2012); Qwest Servs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 536–37 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The FDA argues that its delisting fits under a “declaratory order”, a type of adjudication which “\[has\] binding legal effect and allow agencies to efficiently apply existing policy to a set of facts without the need for any particular party to risk penalty or sanction to resolve a dispute” (FDA Opposition to PI, Case Doc 97, 2/20).   

Weighing all the submitted records and arguments, the “substantial ink” the OFA has spilled ""arguing that FDA should have engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking” (LLY Memo of Law in Opposition to PI Motion, Case Doc 89, 2/18) is exactly that – the odds are strongly against the OFA. We conclude that not only is the motion for preliminary injunction will likely not be granted by Judge Pittman, a non-zero probability exists for the injunction to be moot entirely should the entire case be decided within the month of March, before the compounding deadline of March 19^(th) set by the FDA. 

Sensitivity Analysis for OFA v. FDA (LLY) 

Like the case itself, the implications for LLY depending on different ruling results are equally complex. To simplify, we designate two potential outcomes for LLY: 

1. Courts grant motion for PI. Whether FDA/LLY appeals, compounders have another \~6 months of legal compounding. We assign a \~20% probability to this scenario. Stock trades down \~0-3%, as the downside risk is the status quo, which we believe to be mostly priced into the stock (based on12/19 price action) 
2. Courts deny motion for PI, or the PI is moot and the Judge rules in favor of FDA/LLY. Deadline of March 19^(th) becomes the effective end date of all legal compounding as the case plays out. We assign a \~80% probability to this scenario. Stock trades up \~5-10%, based on our SOTP valuation of LLY below in which we attribute around \~75% of LLY market cap to its ex-Orfor GLP1 business, as well as our estimation of the GLP1 compounding market size to be \~20-30% of the total GLP1 market (below). 

We view OFA v. FDA risks as mostly to the upside. While LLY supply capacity is a key area of focus, any de-risking of uncertainty around compounding is likely to benefit LLY. Quantitatively, we estimate the market compounders are currently capturing that will largely move under LLY’s column under a positive ruling. 

# Catalyst 2: Orforglipron Phase 3 ACHIEVE-1 Data 

Orforglipron (Orfor) is an oral GLP1 agonist with potential to transform the diabetes and obesity market. Expected to reach market \~2 years before any competitor orals, LLY will enjoy significant first-to-market advantage and further dominant share if successful. Top-line data from multiple Phase 3 (Ph3) trials are expected this year for Orfor, beginning with ACHIEVE-1 in April, which focuses on Orfor for patients with Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) (study [here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05971940#study-plan)). The key metrics to focus on for the study are the: 

1. Weight loss percentage: target of >7%, which implies weight loss for non-T2D obesity patients in the mid-teens, based on Tirzepatide T2D/Obesity comparison 
2. Discontinuation rate, specifically due to adverse effects (AEs): target of <10% 
3. HbA1C lowering profile (): target of >1.5%, which implies effectiveness in controlling blood sugar levels for T2D patients 

Table 1. Trial Results and Targets for Oral/Injectable GLP1s 

|| || | |Weight Loss  |Discontinuation Rate (due to AEs) |HbA1C Lowering Profile  |Weeks (Total, Titration) | |Orfor Ph2 (T2D) |8.2% |15% |1.8% |26 (2-6 weeks) | |Orfor Ph3 Targets (T2D) |>7% |<10% |>1.5% |40 (16 weeks) | |Tirzepatide Ph2 (T2D) |9.7% |25% |1.8% |26 (2-6 weeks) | |Tirzepatide Ph3 (T2D) |9.1% |7% |2.0% (later trials up to 2.5%) |40 (20 weeks) | |Rybelsus Ph2 (NVO Oral) |7% |12% |1.8-2% |52 (26 weeks) |

Most critical to Orfor Ph3 success is being able to outperform a weight loss percentage of 7% while maintaining a discontinuation rate lower than 10%. There is reason for investors to be confident in Orfor Ph3 data at least meeting expectations considering precedence with comparable Tirzepatide Ph2 and Ph3 trials. LLY management has indicated that increasing the titration period in Tirzepatide Ph3 trials helped reduce discontinuation rates from 25% to 7%; Orfor Ph3 sees a comparable increase in titration from 2-6 weeks to 16 weeks. Furthermore, strong HbA1C and weight loss percentages readings in Ph2 data has been a strong indicator of consistency in Ph3 trials as well; a 5% deviation from the Ph2 8.2% weight loss puts Ph3 well above our target of 7%.  

Additional confidence can be found in LLY management stockpiling a “pre-launch inventory” of over 550 MM worth of Orfor (article [here](https://www.tipranks.com/news/eli-lilly-lly-stockpiles-weight-loss-pill-ahead-of-regulatory-approval)) even before the first Ph3 trial data readout. The current stockpile would represent over 10 B in Orfor sales.  

Sensitivity Analysis for Orfor Ph3 ACHIEVE-1 

Like the OFA v. FDA catalyst, the market reactions for Orfor Ph3 data in April will be complex and nuanced. To simplify, we model it with three most likely scenarios: 

1. Beating expectations. Weight loss >7%, HbA1C reduction >1.5%, and discontinuation rate due to AEs <10%. We assign a 70% probability to this case. Stock trades up \~5-10% as we shift to an Orfor bull-case in addition to de-risking. 
2. Meeting expectations. Weight loss \~5-6%, HbA1C reduction \~1-1.5%, and discontinuation rate due to AEs >10%. We assign a 20% probability to this case. Stock trades even at around \~0-3% due to de-risking of Orfor.  
3. Missing expectations/failure. We assign a 10% probability to this case. Stock trades down \~5-10%. 

We assign stock movements for Orfor Ph3 based on our SOTP valuation for LLY below, in which we attribute around \~10% of LLY market cap to the Orfor pipeline. 

# LLY SOTP Valuation 

Table 2. LLY SOTP Valuation at $930/share implying an enterprise value of \~860B.  

|| || |Business |Enterprise Value |Percentage of EV |Equity Price/Share | |Ex-Obesity/Diabetes |170 B |20% |186 | |Orforglipron |90 B |10% |93 | |GLP1 Ex-Orfor |600 B |70% |651 | |Total |860 B |100% |930 |

We break down LLY into three key segments for our SOTP valuation: 

1. Ex-obesity/diabetes. Excluding obesity and diabetes, LLY pipelines and drugs, such as Kisunla for early-stage Alzheimer's, are also promising. This segment represents around \~57% of FY24 revenue and around \~20% of the enterprise value.  
2. GLP1 Ex-Orfor. Excluding Orfor, we price LLY to have \~60% of the total GLP1 market across biopharmaceutical companies.  OFA v. FDA is the main catalyst for this segment of the business, which can increase the total market by \~20-30%. A conservative projection of LLY capturing 60% share of a GLP1 compound market shrunk by \~50-75% due to price-demand elasticity gives between an \~8-15% increase in GLP1 Ex-Orfor segment valuation, reflecting a \~5-10% increase in share price on the conservative end.  
3. Orfor segment. We estimate that the market currently prices Orfor at 90 B, which implies LLY capturing \~60% of the oral GLP1 market by 2033 with 12 B in Orfor sales at a probability of success (POS) of 70%. With a Ph3 de-risking of Orfor POS to around \~90%, Orfor segment valuation in the base-case increases by \~30% or around 27 B EV, reflecting a \~3% increase in share price. However, it also increases the probability of the bull case in which LLY captures upwards of 75% share in the oral GLP1 market, which would command at least a 175 B valuation assuming conservatively that total oral GLP1 market does not increase as well, adding 85 B EV, reflecting a \~10% increase in share price.  

# Price Target – Catalyst-Adjusted Valuation  

Given significant confidence ahead of market consensus in both Catalyst 1 and 2 being positive for LLY, we use our SOTP and sensitivity analysis to drive our price target: 

1. Catalyst 1 gives \~5-10% share price increase at a POS of 80%, \~0-3% share price decreases at a POS of 20%, reflecting a probability weighted \~5.7% price increase. 
2. Catalyst 2 gives \~10% share price increase at a POS of 70%, a \~3% share price increase at a POS of 20%, and a \~10% share price decrease at a POS of 10%, reflecting a probability weighted \~6.6% price increase 

Combining these two catalysts, we derive a base-case upside of \~12.5% for LLY, with a bull-case upside of \~21%, reflecting a base-case PT of $1046 and a bull-case PT of $1135. We derive the bull case using a POS of 100% for both Catalyst 1 and 2. 

# Other Considerations 

Given the current regulatory environment and political landscape, it would be imprudent to not address sector and market risks impacting LLY. Fortunately for LLY, their business and sector are not at the center of any significant prospective tariffs, making biotechnology relatively attractive from a market-risk perspective. Healthcare and biotechnology have been traditionally defensive plays during times of uncertainty, reflected in LLY’s 0.47 beta despite its high valuation. A cursory comparison of the movements of LLY and the broader market in the past 1-2 weeks will demonstrate the low-beta nature of LLY. In fact, I believe a 0.47 beta overstates LLY’s exposure to market risks. 

The pharmaceutical tariff of 25% as the Trump administration has floated would certainly impact LLY. However, LLY is also investing significantly (50 B pledged) in domestic manufacturing, and North American currently represents \~73% of their total revenue. CEO David Ricks cites regulatory tailwinds, such as additional tax cuts on the 2017 Trump Tax Cut, as main motivators for the 50 B investment in the US. As a result, it is unclear whether the Trump administration will be a net benefit or detriment to LLY.  

Lone Pine Capital 

As an interesting aside, Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund with both a Long Only and Long/Short arm, added a new, sizable position in LLY in 4Q24 according to their 13F filing [here](https://13f.info/13f/000090266425001072-lone-pine-capital-llc-q4-2024), and more clearly visualized [here](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Lone+Pine+Capital). A long position of 782k shares at an average price of 828/share representing a position of 604 MM and 4.5% of their total portfolio indicates confidence in the company. 

# Constructing the Trade 

Given our bullish stance on two significant catalysts in the upcoming \~1-2 months, we position ourselves long with slightly OTM May25 1000c calls at \~27 for maximum exposure to these catalysts. If we hold until expiry, the base-case PT of 1046 and the bull-case PT of 1135 represent a \~72% and \~405% return, respectively.

Cannabis was a shit trade over the last 4 years. Anyone who touched the sector was immediately sent to baggy land. The $MJUS ETF got delisted, market caps down 90%+, the AUMs of cannabis funds sliding to zero, there's zero investor confidence.

Look at that shit stain of a chart.

https://preview.redd.it/t327lusxasme1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ab666c7b4de79cc30c7f58738dcb2a15b8090d

Guh

Anyone around in 2021 was familiar with the cannabis bull run. Stinky stoner teens in their moms' basements tossing their stimmy checks at shit like Tilray. It was all garbage. Everyone knew it, but the bet was federal legalization would bake in all the hype valuation.

After 🥭left in 2020, weed bulls were hype for ♿. Biden hit the office in 2021 and made it clear he didn't care about federal legalization. Efforts in congress grinded to a halt. Momentum faded and so did the share price.

Wishful thinking slapped the hand of dipshit trendfollowing retail yet again (I see you, $PLTR baggy!), and has seriously punished anyone holding cannabis over the last 4 years.

But of course, where there's enough blood in the water, you buy.

$CNBS is basically the last way to get broad exposure to US weed stocks now. All the other ETFs died. Here's what they hold.

https://preview.redd.it/nm631kpobsme1.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d67edb3fc075fe0d3f03e08f90f6281d022d766

And honestly, the valuations on these companies look **really fucking attractive** now.

Let's crack open Green Thumb, 1.6B market cap.

https://preview.redd.it/ssem3fzvbsme1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=77242229227d439e25bd3e6eb3f2a92c1c5a9d6a

Share price down 90%+ has led to the company trading for \~7x operating income.

You also get $711M of tangible book value. That's basically half the market cap.

Of course, management for all these cannabis stocks were busy smoking the product in 2020-2022 and decided to acquire a bunch of shit for way more than they should have. This has inflated their goodwill on the balance sheet substantially, but their return on tangible assets is actually really good.

You can calculate the Buffett Return (similar to ROIC/ROA) to get an idea of how they are pushing income on their assets:

**Buffett-style Return Calculation:**

* Buffett-style Return = Owner Earnings / (Inventory + PP&E)
* Buffett-style Return = $245,012,000 / $550,163,000
* Buffett-style Return ≈ 0.445 or 44.5%

Green Thumb looks super attractive **at today's sales and revenue, assuming ZERO growth.**  Their return is quite high, you're getting the business with substantial tangible book value, and at a single digit multiple to operating income. What else could you ask for?

That is the recurring thesis you will see with these holdings, that pessimism has peaked to the point that **weed could never be federally legal, no future states could choose to legalize, and the valuations here still make sense.**

Let's move to holding #2 Trulieve

Stinky EBITDA after taxes.

What sucks about this industry is that the tax bills are massive. They're against the revenue and not the operating income of the business, so there's no real way to avoid them. They're also really, really high. But, it doesn't make Trulieve uninvestible.

At 775M market cap, Trulieve has 487M in tangible book value, about 2/3 of the market cap. That's a wild margin of safety. COGS and OPEX are also decreasing significantly. It looks like their gross margins are substantially increasing though. The stock looks pretty cheap at \~4X EBITDA. Even if we use their shitty EBITDA-Taxes, they're trading at \~7x the 3 year average.

Finally, I want to look at Curaleaf.

https://preview.redd.it/by7x70h2jsme1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4342887167ea0fa5d5d1ba792459fae65266c375

Beautiful profitability and steady with the revenue while increasing their margins. Always great to see.

At 780M market cap, Curaleaf actually has negative tangible book value of 800M. But you're paying 780M market cap for an amazing reason. The company is trading for about 4X cash flow, easily the best value proposition on an income multiple.

**My position:**

I am currently holding 500 shares long of $CNBS for around $10,000.

https://preview.redd.it/pny1ljdejsme1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e21b417618d101699f7deb0d64d276a5c5bc52

I believe the tariff talk has caught these stocks in an unintentional crossfire considering the close Canadian ties. Obviously the chart technicals don't help.

Honestly, I'm bias towards buying deep value situations under deep investor pessimism. It's [how I made my bags on $BABA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h55bbd/china_bad_baba_good_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which is up over 50% in the past 3 months since posting. These situations where investor emotions are clouding business fundamentals are my bread and butter, and hopefully some people here see the value as well.

I'm comfortable holding a relatively small position in Cannabis. If we don't get legalization, these bets are placed at fair value for their current operations. If we do get legalization in more states, or federal legalization, you know exactly what these stocks are doing. Up, up, up, but downside here is very muted. Asymmetrical risk at its finest.

TL;DR: Buy weed stocks, they're cheap, sentiment is horrible, can't really get worse from here. $CNBS",0,,2025-03-04,0.0,0.9962,0.8978838920593262,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.24905,0.6734129190444946,0.4612314595222473,73.06157297611236,positive

Anyway, let me explain why I think it’s time to load the boat on shares on $FLOW / Flow traders. This company, and especially how it’s a play to cash in on the recent market volatility and their blowout earnings report.

They’re a global liquidity provider. They capitalize on market volatility by trading a wide range of financial products, including ETFs, equities, and digital assets. In short for every trade, Flow Traders earns green dildos

# The Play: Buying $FLOW on takeaways from their blowout quarter

Flow Traders has been crushing it with their trading strategies and capital expansion plan, and the recent increase in market volatility means their trading income went through the roof.

Think about it: with the current macroeconomic uncertainties, geopolitical turmoil, and unexpected changes in central bank interest rate policies, volatility levels have spiked. Flow Traders is set to rake in massive trading income from these market conditions.

# Why Flow Traders' Recent Success Signals Big Wins 🚀

Flow Traders' Q4 2024 earnings smashed expectations, revealing major growth in their trading income—a sector they dominate. Here’s the breakdown:

1. [**Record-Breaking Quarter](https://www.flowtraders.com/news/flow-traders-4q-2024-results/)**: Flow Traders recorded Net Trading Income of €153.8 million in Q4 2024, an increase of 112% compared to Q4 2023.This showcases their ability to capitalize on market volatility.
2. **Market Capitalization Increase**: The company ended 2024 with record levels of Trading Capital and Shareholders’ Equity at €775 million and €766 million, respectively. This solid financial foundation positions them well for future growth.
3. **Volatility Surge**: The increase in volatility due to macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical turmoil has created opportunities for Flow Traders to capture temporary price dislocations and generate significant trading income

wallstreetbets,Teekay Tankers (TNK): The Hidden Winner of the Tariff War,1j3hqq9,TheOneNeartheTop,2025-03-04 13:29:18,15,0.77,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j3hqq9/teekay_tankers_tnk_the_hidden_winner_of_the/,"Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) stands to benefit from the current trade dynamics and longer-term geopolitical shifts, potentially making it a compelling investment in today's volatile market.

# Short-Term Catalyst: Tariffs and Trade Route Changes

With the U.S. imposing tariffs (10-20%) on Canadian crude imports, Canadian producers will likely begin exploring alternative markets. While the U.S. remains Canada's primary customer, higher costs could temporarily push some oil onto tankers headed for overseas markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. Increased tanker traffic means longer shipping distances and higher daily charter rates, directly benefiting tanker companies like Teekay Tankers. One of the reasons why the oil is tariffed less than other goods is to ensure that the tariff is just high enough to put it on the edge of shipping oil to other refineries, but this is just the short term catalyst. Shipping oil to an overseas refinery will add about 10% to the cost of the finished product which means the oil won't immediately flow overseas, but it will start. With Europe still heavily sanctioning Russia and Canada/Mexico being heavily tariffed, new trade routes will be utilized over the coming months. However, this is just a short term catalyst.

# Long-Term Catalyst: Potential Return of Russian Oil Imports

If the US rolls over and sanctions are lifted against Russa, Russian crude shipments to the U.S. would resume, significantly increasing tanker demand. Russian crude, such as Urals blend, transported from Russian ports to the U.S. Gulf Coast or East Coast refineries, would generate higher tanker utilization rates, boosting Teekay's revenues substantially. Per barrel it would probably cost >8$ to ship from Russia to the Gulf Coast refineries which at current oil prices is roughly around 10% (equal to Trumps tariffs). This makes it economically viable for Russia to sell Ural oil to the United States, not to mention that since they've been sanctioned for so long they are probably just bursting to sell some non-dark-shipped oil to the global market.

Not to mention that in this scenario Canada would also likely start shipping more oil overseas. The trade routes will be absolutely wonky. Russia shipping to the USA, Canada shipping to Europe.

# Financial Health & Valuation

Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) is currently trading below its book value, offering investors an appealing valuation. In a recession where inflation will be an issue it's often recommended to trade in commodities because they hold their value while everything else loses value to inflation or just loses value straight up. You know what doesn't lose value? Capital assets in a growing sector. TNK owns their ships outright and is currently trading at less than their fleet value (which is normal for a shipping company). It's a safe haven AND a growth sector:

* **Fleet Asset Value:** Approximately $1.548 billion
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Extremely low at \~0.03, minimal debt concerns
* **Market Cap vs. Asset Value:** Currently trading below book value, TNK offers a compelling valuation opportunity.E

# The Win-Win Scenario

* **Short-term:** Trade tariffs disrupt established North American crude logistics, increasing tanker demand.
* **Long-term:** Potential reopening of Russian crude routes to the U.S. market significantly expands TNK's long-haul demand, further elevating long-term profitability.

# Investment Thesis:

* **Near-term upside:** Immediate tanker rate boosts due to trade disruptions.
* **Long-term potential:** Major upside from resuming Russian crude imports.
* **Financially attractive:** Trading below book value with minimal debt risk.

Given this scenario, **Teekay Tankers (TNK)** offers an attractive risk-reward profile while the rest of the market dumps, expect TNK to offer a safe haven & growth. Investors looking for a sector-specific play during geopolitical disruptions should seriously consider this undervalued tanker operator.

First let me start off by saying I'm not a bitcoin bull and think it's all bullshit. However, I've been trading it for the past 6 years and made a ton of money doing so. Why? Because bitcoin ALWAYS pumps off of any catalyst. $MSTR is a stock that holds bitcoin and is a way to buy call options and make a ton of money off it's moves.

Over the weekend CNBC announced on Friday this week the White House is hosting it's first ever Bitcoin Summit and they are going to lay out the ground work for a Bitcoin Reserve and Trump is going to speak about the future of crypto. The most obvious play is ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" going into this event. All bitcoin holders have been waiting since the election to find out more about the Bitcoin Reserve and that's all they care about. $MSTR has been meeting with Trump and the administration and will be one of the leaders in this effort. Now that the tariffs finally hit I believe $MSTR OTM calls are an easy 50 bagger and it will go back to the $300 level it ALREADY hit yesterday and higher going into Fridays event.

Edit 1: Around 12 PM today it was announced CEO of $MSTR (Micahel Saylor) will be joining the Crypto event on Friday at the White House with Trump

wallstreetbets,[DD] Critical Minerals II: The Domestic Supply Chain Strikes Back,1j3bsy2,Steve_Zissouu,2025-03-04 09:19:30,14,0.94,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j3bsy2/dd_critical_minerals_ii_the_domestic_supply_chain/,"Hi all, this is meant to be a followup to the last \[DD\][ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/). The thesis of that post was:

>**Thesis/Summary:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals.

In this post, I want to go over further developments in my research on this sector and the subsequent adjustments that I’ve made to my portfolio as a result.  I’ll start with a bit of methodology. Among the guiding considerations I have found reasonable:

1. Priority should be given to domestic companies looking to mine, refine, and develop critical metals/minerals in the USA or who may be substantial suppliers of our critical minerals stockpile. Secondary priority should be given to companies that are part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or otherwise western-aligned, and wishing to mine, refine, or develop critical metals/minerals in the USA, or who may be stockpile suppliers.
2. Priority should be given to companies that have substantial federal contracts already or have projects presently awaiting government permits, funding, or regulative actions, where such action would be expressly in the USA national security interest.
3. Priority should be given to companies that have institutionally and politically well-resourced members involved in their board, leadership, governing body.
4. Priority should be given to companies represented unusually strongly in the portfolio of major hedge funds, have unusual levels of insider activity, and/or are represented in the financial disclosures of politicians in Washington, D.C. 
5. Priority should be given to companies that have established they can deliver results or who have a head start in their particular niche of the industry relative to competitors.

Given this, a lot of my research has presently been focused on evaluating degrees of institutional, political, and insider support for the companies that, *prima facie,* appear to have their interests aligned with the federal government in that the success of the company supports federal objectives.

Specifically, here is what I have done since last writing:

1. I combed through the 2024 financial disclosures of the administration and his various cabinet members to evaluate whether they had considerable equity in this sector and, if so, where.
2. I combed through 13F and NPORT filings from the heavy-hitting hedge funds, investment managers, and so on (e.g. Blackrock, Citadel, …) to evaluate their posturing.
3. I did research into which companies work with which metals/minerals and where, if any, there are bottlenecks in their growth that may be eased w/ deregulation, federal support.
4. I looked into which individuals, with ties to the mining and metals industry, appear to also be tied to, or otherwise cozy with, the president, or members of his administration. I then looked into their financial disclosures, etc, as well, at least to the extent possible.
5. Wherever I found an investment firm, LLC, etc, that I did not recognize, but which has been making substantial recent investments in this sector and in the companies I have flagged, I went on to also research who was behind them and their affiliations.

Strategies like this can be hampered by the delay between position adjustments and submission of financial disclosures. Hence, this does have its risks. Nonetheless, I found interesting data. For example, when I was looking into MP materials, I noticed substantial **($200 million+)** investments opened Q4 2024 (that is, as of December 31, 2024)  by “Hancock Prospecting Pty.” I also noticed the fund was **$2billion+ in total.** I had never heard of this group.  Did a little looking into it and it turns out to be managed by [**Gina Rinehart**](https://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/gina-rinehart-revealed-as-owner-of-2b-us-stock-portfolio/)**,** a mining magnate and Australia’s richest person, who also happens to be close enough with Mangoes hat [she attended his inauguration party in January](https://www.atlasiron.com.au/pratt-rinehart-to-attend-trumps-inauguration/), alongside the usual cabal of tech billionaires and politicians. Look at this[ adorable photo of her](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/be-like-donald-trump-gina-rinehart-tells-nations-leaders/news-story/86084df17ee039ba0c4c963d1be45256?amp) with Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, who also attended.

As I said, in Q4 2024, Rinehart’s fund opened substantial new positions, including $200million+ in MP materials. Of the investments I listed in my last research post, the fund also opened up new positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars in TSLA, ALB, others...

I also learned in this past research cycle that the president has investments in companies like UUUU and CAT, that Kash Patel has investments in MP materials and CAT, and that Ken Griffins (Citadel) increased his share in MP materials by 2500% in Q4 (albeit, he also shifted his derivatives b/w the long Call/Put spread he likes to keep on many of his holdings).

[**John Paulson**,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-05/election-2024-john-paulson-is-raising-43-million-for-trump) a close friend and billionaire supporter of the president, who is perhaps most famous for his bet against the housing market in 2008, which made him $20 billion richer, also has investments in PPTA (Perpetua Resources).

[Dated screenshot of my positions as of last weekend](https://preview.redd.it/e1cc8cnb5ome1.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=99201d7e9eef23580c08cc6e0d39cf7242528b35)

**TL;DR**

1. **Another Failed Privatization Attempt?**: Nordstrom’s previous privatization at $50 per share in 2018 was rejected by the board, and the company’s current financial performance shows a sharp decline, making such valuations unrealistic today. Having failed just 8 years ago at a much higher price, are they settling too low an amount and will shareholders vote against this privitization?
2. **Tariffs on Mexican Goods**: The recent U.S.'s 25% tariff on Mexican imports creates a significant challenge for any Mexican entity trying to acquire Nordstrom, especially given the company’s reliance on Mexican manufacturing.
3. **Ryan Cohen’s 4.2% Stake**: Cohen still holds a significant stake in Nordstrom, which could mean he's preparing for a potential strategic shift, sale, or restructuring.

**1. Another Failed Privatization Attempt – Once bitten, Twice shy**

Let’s start with the history of Nordstrom (JWN) and a significant event that raised red flags for investors: the failed privatization attempt in 2018. The Nordstrom family made a bold attempt to take the company private at **$50 per share**, valuing the company at roughly **$8 billion**. This price point was based on optimism about the company’s prospects, and it was underpinned by Nordstrom's relatively strong revenue at the time.

The failed acquisition at the $50 per share valuation is a major indicator that investors, including the Nordstrom family, were betting on a much brighter future. Given the company’s current situation, a sale or acquisition at those former high prices may seem like a long shot now. The market sentiment, investor confidence, and Nordstrom’s future outlook don’t match the price tag that was set years ago. However given that they have also raised [FY24 outlook](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstrom-raises-fy24-revenue-outlook-185200374.html) one ponders if the acquisition price tag of **$24.25/share** is a fair one and shareholders will vote against this price?

**2. The 25% Tariff on Mexican Goods – A New Complication for Potential Acquirers**

A major new development that could make any acquisition of Nordstrom even more complicated is the recent **25% tariff** imposed by the U.S. on all goods from Mexico. With Nordstrom having significant supply chains in Mexico – especially in terms of manufacturing and sourcing goods – these tariffs could have a substantial negative impact on the company’s cost structure.

As many of Nordstrom's products come from Mexican manufacturers, these tariffs will result in **higher production costs**, potentially leading to **lower margins** or increased prices for consumers. This economic strain might make Nordstrom less appealing to potential acquirers, particularly those from Mexico. The potential acquirer **Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V.**  said to have an interest in purchasing JWN, but these new tariffs complicate the calculus.

Given that the 25% tariff adds a layer of financial complexity, the attractiveness of a Nordstrom acquisition to a Mexican-based entity is highly diminished. These higher costs may force potential acquirers to either reprice their offers downward or back out of the deal entirely. This new trade barrier strengthens the likelihood that JWN could face prolonged struggles as its international market appeal is reduced.

**3. Ryan Cohen’s 4.2% Stake – A Wildcard in the Mix**

Another intriguing aspect to consider is **Ryan Cohen**, the **Chewy** co-founder and activist investor. Cohen has long been known for shaking up companies in which he invests. He holds a **4.2% stake** in Nordstrom,  although this stake does not give him a significant voice in the company’s strategy. Cohen’s involvement in JWN raises several questions. Is he planning to influence the company’s direction or initiate changes that could lead to a potential sale? 

Given his involvement in **a gaming company**, Cohen has proven that he is not afraid to make bold moves to alter the fate of a company. Whether that means pushing for a restructuring, a sale, or advocating for a shift in the company’s strategic direction, Cohen’s presence on the shareholder registry is worth watching closely.

The real question becomes: **How will Cohen leverage his position?** Is he trying to push for a sale of the company at a time when its valuation is low, but the market is volatile, and the company is struggling?",0,,2025-03-04,0.7712,0.9638,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.81935,0.0,0.409675,70.48375,positive

And this is supposed to be OpenAI's biggest model, so big that it's like 10x more expensive than other apis.

It might signal that's there's limits to scaling model sizes, which would slash forecasts on the number GPU's people are going to buy.

Combine that with deepseek reaching great levels with much less compute, and that may signal that there is a limit of number of GPUs people need to reach the highest levels of AI.

Something nobody is really talking about is what a rare Earth minerals mining deal with the U.S. & Ukraine is doing to bring Russia to negotiate, so it is assumed by some that somehow the Russians will be buying the output from American operations there.

The lithium and other excavation companies were pretty volatile last year, so I'm not sure how much of this was already priced in.

They are probably going to make a deal regardless of the tumultuous interaction in the White House last week, but there is still a possibility that it all falls apart for the U.S.

Some people have been whispering about how Trump might have been positioning for personal gain on this, but since Canadian & European mining operations are also equally qualified (and available on the American exchange) it is likely that Zelenskyy now knows how valuable it is what they have.

- Canada and Mexico: A 25% tariff applies to all goods, with a 10% tariff on Canadian crude oil and energy products. These tariffs disrupt North American supply chains, especially in the automotive sector, and may lead to increased vehicle and other goods prices for consumers. They’ve already caused declines in global stock markets.

- China: An additional 10% tariff raises the total tariff rate to 20%. The U.S. administration cites the ongoing fentanyl opioid crisis as the reason.

High short interest indicates that a substantial number of investors are betting against a company’s stock, anticipating a price decline. Notable examples include:
	•	Enphase Energy (ENPH): This solar company has attracted significant bearish bets due to challenges from Chinese competition and high interest rates.  ￼
	•	Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Known for its high short interest, indicating potential investor skepticism.  ￼
	•	Albemarle (ALB): A lithium producer facing considerable short interest, possibly due to concerns over lithium market dynamics.  ￼
	•	Fox Corporation (FOXA): The media company has seen increased short positions, suggesting bearish sentiment.  ￼
	•	Moderna (MRNA): Despite its role in COVID-19 vaccine development, Moderna has experienced significant short interest, potentially due to uncertainties about future revenue streams.  ￼

2. Companies with Recent Earnings Misses:

Missing earnings expectations can lead to negative investor sentiment and potential stock price declines. Recent examples include:
	•	Crawford & Company B (CRD.B): Reported quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share, missing estimates of $0.24.  ￼
	•	Vistra (VST): Reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.14 per share, significantly below the expected $2.17.  ￼
	•	Deere & Company (DE): Reported a 30% decline in revenue and a 50% drop in net income for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year.  ￼
	•	Okta (OKTA): Released earnings that fell short of expectations by $0.48 per share.  ￼

3. Sector-Specific Challenges:

Certain sectors are facing headwinds that could impact stock performance:
	•	Semiconductor Industry: Companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have experienced recent corrections, and upcoming earnings reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) could influence investor sentiment in the AI and semiconductor space.  ￼
	•	Australian Energy Sector: Companies such as Boss Energy Ltd (BOE) and Paladin Energy Ltd (PDN) are among the most shorted ASX shares, indicating potential vulnerabilities.  ￼

Cautionary Note:

Investing based on short-term predictions carries inherent risks. It’s essential to conduct thorough research and consider consulting a financial advisor before making investment decisions.

**TL;DR** If Europe continues to be serious about cutting ties with the USA, cloud computing will shift towards domestic options. There are only two clear publicly-traded choices, IOS and OVH. Many private companies also exist in this sector, but if there is a race for the EU everyone probably wins enough not to care.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Glad for any constructive feedback and discussion. This is some fresh thinking so I expect there are serious holes in the logic, and there are definitely other sectors to consider.

Those of you tuned into the EU/USA relationship may have noted things are a bit interesting at the moment. For the past few years RHM would jump on any escalation of the Ukraine war, but after the latest American presidential inauguration basically every defense-related stock in Europe is going vertical. Some tickers and their change since January 20:

* Rheinmetall (RHM) +70%
* BAE Systems (BA) +30%
* Leonardo (LDO) +80%
* Thales (HO) +45%
* Thyssen-Krupp (TKA) +150%
* Dassault Systemes (DSY) +15%
* MTU Aero Engines (MTX)  +4%
* Hensoldt (HAG) +90%
* Safran SA (SAF) +15%
* Rolls Royce (RR) +35%

But that is not the topic for today.

Today we look into the future and see that Europe will realize that its entire compute infrastructure is essentially developed, owned, and operated by American companies. While the tech companies are not nationalized by the American government, the fact that reclusive billionaires who were mostly out of the game are coming back to assert that they will play ball (Sergey Brin calling for 60-hour work weeks...) suggests that something is going on in the background. People will become increasingly concerned about the potential for a widescale cyberattack comparable to Stuxnet, except that the target is the entire European economy rather than Iranian nuclear facilities.

So what can Europe and the EU do, apart from nothing?

First, there is the option to reinforce existing legislation regarding privacy and security of data. The EU already effectively operates as a second Internet due to GDPR, which results in data processing happening in specific geographic regions (i.e. not USA) and users being allowed to refuse to certain types of data processing (e.g. cookie banners). As a consequence, cloud providers have options for noting exactly where data be stored, processed, or transmitted. That said, many US websites are simply not available in the EU due to a lack of desire to attempt to comply, including many news sites and certain home improvement stores. Adding new legislation could look something like ensuring that the compute infrastructure must be audited, that staff must be EU nationals, or something else which enables oversight on the supply chain a la the existing guidance [\[2\]](https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/guidelines/guidelines-use-cloud-computing-services-european_en). I expect something to happen in this space, but mostly reactive and definitely too late.

Second, USA companies can fork their operations and sell off European assets to these new European entities. This would be a fairly disruptive shift given that the workers in different regions can have dramatically different skillsets and pay grades. For example, tech giants like Google would have to give up access to their cheap labor in Europe, where wages are typically not more than half of the Silicon Valley standard [\[3\]](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer/locations/berlin-metropolitan-region?dma=10025). This can be a motivating factor for the push towards automation of knowledge work as a whole: just as outsourcing software development from EU to Ukraine was disrupted by the war, so too would be American outsourcing to Europe if the US-Russia/EU conflict escalates.

Third, EU companies (and elsewhere) can choose to move off of AWS, Azure, and GCP onto EU equivalents. Which brings us to the point: what are the European cloud computing companies that we can invest in?

If we dig through the database of European alternatives for cloud computing [\[4\]](https://european-alternatives.eu/category/cloud-computing-platforms), things are a bit dire. After all, Europe basically did not develop a real software infrastructure and barely has an understanding of the associated mindset, so most of these services seem to be technically sound but small. Plus, many companies (e.g. Hetzner) are built in the German Mittelstand style of close private ownership and thus we have no easy access for investment.

If we are to look at an ideal option for investment we should consider the following:

* The first movers will likely be security- and stability-minded because that is what motivates them to be proactive. They are likely to put up with rough edges in the short term in exchange for the bare-metal ownership, and thus will likely target companies with resilient hosting of both compute and data (e.g. automatic replication in distinct geographies). I expect many firms in defense and finance are already considering or have already implemented these plans.
* The big wave of movers will likely focus on reactive migration of existing services. They may have considered migrating but have not executed on it out of either caution, a lack of initiative, or simply a last of a sense of urgency. Some large event will scare them into action and thus their priority will be on wholesale rapid migration of their existing systems to the EU, as quickly as possible and essentially without consideration of cost. The winner here will either be the big firm which everyone knows is not wrong (does not yet exist) or the one with the smoothest sales onboarding and experience. Think back to uptake of Zoom during the pandemic versus all of the also-rans (Blue Jeans, Jitsi, GoToMeeting, Skype, Teams, Google Meet, Cisco...). If you are sitting there panicked by the scope of the work but are greeted with a friendly and reassuring interface, you can make it work and you will not care about the price tag. So, a good migration user experience will triumph over a good developer experience in the mid term. During this period, price gouging may happen but likely will be monitored by the EU to some extent.
* After that wave of migration, developers may start to complain enough that the developer experience becomes important, and the European frugality will drive prices down. This phase is more about the 5-year picture and may be disrupted by the sheer volume of people on the platform that won in the short term.
* Finally, hardware supply chains will come under scrutiny but in general it will be decided that it is too expensive to rip out existing systems except in the most clearly critical systems. This is probably a mistake from a security perspective but the line has to be drawn somewhere. That said, if companies like Visa or Mastercard come under scrutiny and get kicked out of Europe then all bets are off.

Catalysts to consider:

* Everyone finally decides to act on the fact that the USA has already de facto decided to leave NATO and the UN, leading to increased pro-European action
* A cyberattack against European or American infrastructure occurs, leading to sanctions
* China invades Taiwan, threatening the hardware supply chain
* USA withdraws troops from some or all of its territories in Europe, threatening the USD
* Russia invades a NATO country, possibly one of the Baltics

So we are looking for companies with as close to a 1-to-1 mapping of existing cloud features as possible, which are already established across Europe, and which have a good interface for migration from other platforms. Digging through a list of European alternatives [\[4\]](https://european-alternatives.eu/category/cloud-computing-platforms) we find exactly two publicly traded options: Ionos (IOS) and OVH Group S.A. (OVH). I also looked at Aruba S.p.A., Cyso Hosting BV, Elastx, Exoscale (owned by A1), gridscale GmbH (owned by OVHcloud), Hetzner Online GmbH, Open Telekom Cloud (owned by T-Systems International GmbH), Seeweb s.r.l., and STACKIT GmbH & Co. KG, but all of these are private and most are small.

This as a searing indictment of the European software scene and of the public markets here as a whole.

https://preview.redd.it/1331yfk9zime1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=275ff950f6a61851862761d0587592e8720f8c25

First up, **Ionos Group SE (IOS)**, market cap 3.5B. They had 1.5B in revenue in 2024 (10% annual growth) with 4100 employees. These guys went public in 2023-02 and are up about 60% since then. Their website is slick enough and hides the dirty details that might scare the casual browser (APIs, SDKs, and related developer documentation). Migration services do seem to exist. At the surface this seems like the people I would try to at minimum get a solid sales call with.

https://preview.redd.it/xamaygmazime1.png?width=2019&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd0acae30fe6463df281e7884eb94f5da178c1a

Second, **OVHcloud (OVH)**, market cap 1.8B. They had 1.2B in revenue in 2024 with 2900 employees. You may know them from the fire they had a few years back [\[5\]](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/ovhcloud-fire-france-data-center/). They have a good range of services but it is not clear that cloud migration is one of them. Stock performance is not great (down 70% since the start of 2022) but we're looking for value here and it seems that they have only just become profitable this past year (see [\[6\]](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2025-01/ovhcloud-2024.11-plaquette-vdef-eng.pdf) and [\[7\]](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023.08_-_ovh_groupe_-_plaquette_-_eng_-_vdef.pdf)). As a potential customer I would talk with this team but it would feel a bit uphill to get through to the migration specialists.

So, where to go from here? I took a small position in both IOS and OVH to get a bit of skin in the game. Both seem to be profitable companies with reasonable growth trajectories. The next phase of DD will be to do a bit of networking and see where sentiment is pushing. If this goes the same way as the defense sector I expect that all cloud companies will see a sharp uptick in sales and valuation, so I would balance holdings across the sector for now rather than picking a winner. Though calling two public companies a ""sector"" is a bit generous.

If the sovereignty logic seems sound to you, then consider analysis of the following sectors:

* Financial infrastructure. Mastercard is already on the radar of the European Commission [\[8\]](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_19_582), and a pro-Europe movement could see Visa and Mastercard as threats
* Computing hardware. While Europe is home to ASML, hardware design firms and fabrication facilities are not as prominent, though places like imec do exist. There is already precedent for additional spending here [\[9\]](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/growth/items/46654/) and TSMC is building a facility in Dresden, Germany [\[10\]](https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3169)
* Intelligence. Where is the European Palantir?
* Petrochemicals. An escalation of conflict with the USA could interrupt trade and result in Europe looking to Norway or Saudi Arabia to improve access.

NEW PARTNERSHIPS:  
\- US: Walmart, McDonalds, Kroger, Target, Costco, Publix.  
\- UK: Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys, Morrisons and Eurogarages.

Expansion into Germany in 2024, 2025 expecting to go into Spain and Brazil. 23,000 global access points!

\- Operating income up 521.68% to 81.72mil in 2024 YoY.

\- Total current liabilities down 7.5%.

\- Total non-current liabilities down 2.05%.

\- Accrued expenses down 7.34%.

\- Net income positive for the first time since 2018.

\- Krispy Kreme's delivered fresh daily sales exceeded $250 million for the first time.

\- 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year organic sales growth. Excluding the cyber incident.

MCDONALDS POTENTIAL IMPACT WITH JUST USA PARTNERSHIP:

\- Average McDonald's location serves approximately 1,100 customers daily  
\- Total daily customers across 12,000 locations: 13.2 million

\- Krispy Kreme expects a presence in nearly 2,000 McDonald's restaurants by the end of this year and **a total of 12,000 by the end of 2026**.

\- Low estimate: 2% of McDonald's customers purchase a doughnut, Annual revenue: $177.3 million

\- Medium estimate: 5% of McDonald's customers purchase a doughnut, Annual revenue: $443.3 million

\- High estimate: 8% of McDonald's customers purchase a doughnut, Annual revenue: $709.2 million

\- McDonald's partnership could represent between 10.6% (low) to 42.5% (high) of Krispy Kreme's current annual revenue.

Estimation done by single donut purchase, we all know we're eating at least 3 :D

Good luck to all, may gains be on your side! 🚀🚀🚀

My position: I want to net at least $20k gains on this position and I believe seeing $17 isn't a big ask, holding long term! They IPOed at $17 and sold a bunch at that price to institutional investors which still hold majority of the shares.

>A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a **Crypto Strategic Reserve** that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114093946326587357

But, there's no such language in the Executive Order, only language is about a stockpile from seized crypto by law enforcement agencies:

>(c)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Working Group shall submit a report to the President, through the APEP, which shall recommend regulatory and legislative proposals that advance the policies established in this order.  In particular, the report shall focus on the following:
(i)   The Working Group shall propose a Federal regulatory framework governing the issuance and operation of digital assets, including stablecoins, in the United States.  The Working Group’s report shall consider provisions for market structure, oversight, consumer protection, and risk management.
(ii)  **The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.**

There's not a single mention of a strategic reserve in the EO. Trump knows this, or maybe he doesn't (or doesn't know the difference between a stockpile or a reserve) or he did a play on words for other nefarious reasons, i.e., tariffs coming Tuesday.

Based on my own research I see Palantir as being similar to Apple in that once you onboard with them you need to stay in their ecosystem as the cost to change is punitive. 

Like Apple it offers a premium suite of services that are not unique but their ecosystem offering is unique. In this way it has a moat. 

Also, it has a massive advantage over competitors as it is B2G first and then B2B second. Also, the DOGE move is bullish as it will further its entrenchment within government systems as Musk pushes to modernize and centralize government data systems.

So, what were my initial plays?

the first big one was off of IBKR. I loved their platform and had taken notice how their stock was rallying really hard so i bought calls:

Additionally, above you'll see some oracle call losses too that i just cut the losses short.

Also saw some volatility and captured a small shift upwards on spy on the 18th

Additionally rode the Palantir fall after their initial slip but got frustrated and sold when they started to look like they were climbing back up:

In hindsight, I should have waited until yesterday at open to close for a bigger profit but I just didn’t feel 100% comfortable with how the market would react to earnings.

Yesterday wrote 40 80DTE NVDA 110 cash secured puts for $25k premium. Maximum loss if NVDA goes to 0 is $414.7k

wallstreetbets,$DNUT: The Panic is Leaving me Glazed and Confused,1j0e6su,Alextsmitty,2025-02-28 13:09:45,57,0.88,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j0e6su/dnut_the_panic_is_leaving_me_glazed_and_confused/,"Krispy Kreme (DNUT) has recently had it's donut hole pounded, with the stock declining over 30% this week following ""poor"" earnings and ratings downgrades. It is now hovering at an all-time low, and in the past year has declined from $17.84 (!!) to where it is now at \~$6. I'm calling the bottom here, and will lay out why sprinkling some DNUT in your portfolio might make you Kreme your pants in a couple years.

# The Cyber Incident in December

On Dec. 11, 2024, the company announced in an 8k filing that they have been hacked. Unauthorized activity on it's information systems disrupted online ordering, and in their Q4 earnings report announced that this resulted in a *material revenue loss of $11 million*. Hole-y shit. The good news is that the donut in IT who allowed this to happen is most likely terminated, and this should be seen as a one off incident.

# Q4 Earnings: Donut Worry, the Worst is Behind Us

Even so, DNUT persisted and still managed to post their 18th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, with yearly revenue at 1.65B, and quarterly revs 404m (Would have been 415m if they didn't get hacked). Sure, net revenue in the US declined, but that is also due to the sale of Insomnia Cookies by the company a ($57.4 million impact). Management is really focused on making their main brand bigger and better, so letting go of Insomnia makes sense. What doesn't make sense, is the downward guidance, with management believing 2025's Net Revenue to be around $1.55-$1.65 billion. To be blunt- this is sandbagged, and I am betting 2025 will return to the upward growth of past years thanks to a newer CEO taking significant action in making US businesses more capital light and restructuring management teams.

Past DNUT Net Revenue:

2021: $1.28B

2022: $1.53B

2023: $1.68B

2024: $1.65B

2025: Company guiding $1.55-1.65B? Nah... more like $1.81B if they grow \~10% like previous years.. and here is why I think they will.

# McDonald's: Donut Sleep on This Partnership

DNUT rocketed last year on the news that they would start rolling out their product into McDonald's restaurants. So far, they are in 1,900 locations, but the CEO expects them to be in over 12,000 by the end of 2026. The math on these McDonuts is mind boggling. (Credit to White Brook Capital for pointing this out)

Price of a donut $1.60, McD commission 60% (total guess here but probably over estimating)

KK net rev per donut $0.64 (minus McDonald’s commission)

Average amount of McDonald's breakfast customers per day: 275 people

With an attach rate of 20%, \~55 donuts will be sold each day

Net rev per day $35.20, minus waste (donuts not sold) and delivery cost of $7 and $25 respectively= $3 net revenue a day which doesn’t seem like much until you take into account that that is $22 per week, $95 per month, $284 per quarter… $1153 per year at each store.

**If we are looking at 12,000 McDonald's in 2 years… that is $13,836,000 in profits each year from McDonalds alone.** And these are conservative estimates. Is your hole feeling glazed yet?! And imagine if they strike deals with other diabetes inducing restaurant chains!

Separately, Krispy Kreme donuts main points of access for consumers are at Target, Walmart, and grocery stores like Amazon/Safeway/Giant/Publix. I usually see these neat little stands when I walk in, and they are near the cash registers to ensure fatasses like myself buy them on an impulse.

# International Growth: Raking in the Dough

A big highlight from the recent earnings that I feel is being overlooked is that in the International segment, net revenue grew $7.4 million, or 5.7% and International organic revenue grew 7.8%. Why? Because the company is executing well in places like Japan and Germany, creating nearly 700 new point of access stores last year alone. I know from experience that Japanese people LOVE American food, they can't get enough of our KFC, cheeseburgers, and now apparently donuts. Their international growth also explains the company's 800m long term debt... but they need to spend to continue expanding and I think they are executing. The company expects leverage to trend towards 4.0x by year end 2025, which is not that concerning. Plus international markets are not effected by irrational fears of RFK Jr. somehow cracking down on donuts and junk food.

# Keep it simple and ""Old Fashioned""

In conclusion, don't over think this one. With a nearly 70% dip from yearly highs, ~~deez nuts~~ these donuts are on discount. This is a good, established product with a cult following and a dominating social media and online presence (over 1 billion impression last year). I have opened a small position that I will add more to overtime. I expect another small dip or two due to market volatility.

Ended up getting some cheap LEAPs spreading from $2 to $20. Was holding for the big launch and landing. Launch went off without a hitch.  Landing hasn't happened yet, but instead of running up to the lunch with hype, it began tanking.  Im down almost $15,000 from the highs.  Im still way up from where I started, but it sucks seeing my account cut down so much.  I started shrinking my stake in order to be a little less risky, but it feels so futile.

I still believe GOOGL and AMZN will make a run back up after weathering this selloff, and I do have some times on my side. But multiple selloff days definitely trickering a little doubts in the play right now. 

My plan is to hold until at least breakeven for most of GOOGL call and start revising based on the economy at the time.

Nothing too interesting or spectacular.

What is interesting is that they announced a 1% annual dividend, in addition to an already disclosed share buyback program of up to 2B worth of TKO stock( 20% reduction of the float with current share price)

This really caught my attention because the ER wasnt particularly good. Despite this, the company is saying that not only they have the cash flow for a 1% annual dividend, but also have enough cash for a 2 billion dollar share buyback.

Another major piece is the fact that insider purchases from the last 3 months is up 700M worth of shares!

PCE comes out tomorrow.  
The bottom has fallen out, I've watched SPY V shape recovery this entire week.  
The hedge funds and market makers have been propping SPY up while they've been selling equities as to not spook the retailers.

That is why large cap stocks were tanking while SPY was only \~3% from its ATH.  
NVDA was the  last bastion of hope, we saw how big funds were more than happy to dump their position this morning and big entities have been on the sidelines for a bit.

Jamie Dimon of JPM sold 1/4 Billion dollars in shares last week.  
Warren Buffett has a record 325+ Billion in cash on the sidelines.

The crooked hedge funds and market makers have finished rotating and re-positioning.  
Tomorrow, we bears feast!

In short, CompoSecure is a company that manufactures metal credit cards. They are one of the main suppliers for Robinhood’s Gold cards.

https://ir.composecure.com/news-releases/news-release-details/partnership-composecure-supported-robinhoods-groundbreaking-gold/

Here recently, lots of insider buying has been reported over the last few weeks by directors at the company

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/cmpo/insider-activity#google_vignette

Today, it was reported that Brad Knott, House Representative from North Carolina, purchased a total of up to $30k in CompoSecure

https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2025/20027846.pdf

Even better? Brad Knott serves on the House Committees of Homeland Security, including the Border Security and Enforcement and Oversight subcommittees. I think if anyone knew who Trump plans to have manufacture these cards, he would be one of them

https://knott.house.gov

Then, we find out yesterday that Trump plans to sell $5 million “gold cards” to wealthy immigrants wanting to get a fast track to citizenship.

# AST SpaceMobile Secures $43 Million Contract in Support of U.S. Space Development Agency Through Prime Contractor

*New contract follows successful testing under the previously announced February 2024 contract award and highlights the capability of AST SpaceMobile's technology for specialized government applications*

February 26, 2025 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time

MIDLAND, Texas--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--[AST SpaceMobile, Inc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fast-science.com%2F&esheet=54215199&newsitemid=20250226892736&lan=en-US&anchor=AST+SpaceMobile%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=5d3234b03385e00a47abae7c06f368e0) (“AST SpaceMobile”) (NASDAQ: ASTS), the company building the first and only space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by everyday smartphones, designed for both commercial and government applications, today announced a new contract award in support of the United States Space Development Agency (SDA) through a prime contractor, with total expected revenue of $43 million.

As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA will accelerate delivery of needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

This contract follows successful testing on BlueWalker-3 in orbit under the previous contract announced in February 2024 and further demonstrates the unique capabilities of AST SpaceMobile's technology for specialized government applications. The company will utilize its next generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites, featuring the largest commercial phased array antennas ever deployed in low Earth orbit – spanning an unprecedented 2,400 square feet – setting a new standard for advanced connectivity and performance.

“This second contract supporting the SDA underscores the confidence in AST SpaceMobile’s innovative technology and its potential to support critical government missions,” said Chris Ivory, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Government Business of AST SpaceMobile. “We are deploying groundbreaking technology to create robust and resilient communications solutions and to enable new use cases for the U.S. government.""

AST SpaceMobile's technology, backed by 3,500 patent and patent-pending claims, offers unique dual-use advantages for both government and commercial customers. Its large, phased-array antennas and innovative architecture provides robust, resilient, and scalable solutions to address evolving mission needs.**AST SpaceMobile Secures $43 Million Contract in Support of U.S. Space Development Agency Through Prime Contractor**

Back at it with another DD.  Going to keep it short as many can’t read complete sentences.  Nailed the last few DDs so hopefully I am right again this time.   I only post when I see a big opportunity.

The stock in play is **NIO**, the Chinese Premium EV Brand.  Yes I know, some of you are already thinking, Chinese stocks no thanks but hear me out.     To start, I moved to China for work and own a NIO ES7 and I am a firm believer. 

**Pros:**  

\-          New addressable markets with two new brands.  FIREFLY (low end consumer), On V0 (middle class consumer)  

\-          ON V0 is a game changer because the current model L60 and future models are priced for the mass market.   \*\*They even have access to NIO’s battery swapping stations!!!\*\*  This is huge because right now there is no brand that currently offers battery swapping.   

\-          Battery Swapping technology is what differentiate NIO from their competitors because it takes 5 minutes to change a battery and you are on your way.   They just completed 1 million swaps during the two weeks from Chinese New Year.  The reason why Tesla abandoned the tech is because infrastructure isn’t there/too expensive, but I can tell you it works and it works flawlessly.

\-          Owns/operate the most battery charging stations in China and along highways, the Shanghai charging/swapping operations are about to turn profitable.   Many EV companies use their charging stations as well.

\-          Priced cheaply compared to all other EV Brands, yes because they are not selling as much but be greedy when others are fearful

\-          US politics is a mess right now and in the near future, with DOGE and Trump creating a lot of uncertainties, I believe funds will move back to China as China is very proactive in getting investments back and is actually publicly protecting/enhancing their tech industry instead of beating them down like few yrs ago(check out Chinese equities)

\-          Their CEO mentioned that NIO is seeking to achieve profitability in the last quarter of 2025!!

\-          They will never go bankrupt as it is backed by the government, Tencent, Abu-Dhabi’s CYVN Holdings , so there is essentially zero risk of bankruptcy

**Cons:**

\-          Low sales numbers relative to all other brands but I firmly believe this will change as more people recognize the utility of battery swaps

\-          Lots of competition in Chinese EV market, but if they break through the mass market, there will be a huge upside

\-          They still have very low sales outside China, so it is less vulnerable to tariff compared to other manufacturers, although they are expanding in Europe and have plans for Middle East.

\-          Hemorrhaging cash but they aim to be profitable year end

 

Everything is coming together for this company.   While other Chinese EV stocks went up a lot already like Xpeng and LI.   They are just amazing cars, period.  Don’t look at outdated review from youtube comparing apples to oranges.  They are great cars.  I firmly because the risk/reward for this is amazing.   Losing 30% of your investment for have a potential for few baggers sounds absolutely amazing to me.   It is absolutely no brainer, just look at my last DD for Palantir, I am still holding it and at a 8 bagger as of today.   I put my money where my mouth is.  No options for me because of the high volatility right now.   

Position is 260,000 shares @ 4.63

Sorry for the long post. Good luck everyone!!

I remember it was like $50 a share in the meme run of 2020. A Disney/Hulu merger was announced in January, causing the stock to run from $1.50 to like $5. 

It’s since cooled down in the tariff talk. The company is not profitable, but seems to be trending that way. 

Curious to know what you think about the long term viability of FUBO and if this stock has any energy left in it for a run to $10+. 

I personally have a couple concerns. I've dealt with these low priced stocks in the dollar range, and they're always super risky. They seem to usually be dilution machines and at the risk of a reverse split. I don't know if this has ever been discussed with regards to FUBO.

There is always the chance the Disney/FUBU merger is shut down by government as well.

> PayPal aims to offer its stablecoin, PYUSD, as an option for its more than 20 million small-to-medium sized merchants to pay vendors through its upcoming bill-pay product by the end of this year. The idea is for merchants to invite their vendors into the PayPal network to facilitate easier transactions, according to Michelle Gill, general manager of PayPal’s small business and financial services group. 

> “A lot of the payments we’re expecting are going to be cross-border because merchants in the US are seeking to pay vendors and suppliers abroad,” Gill said in an interview with Bloomberg during PayPal’s investor day on Tuesday. “The thesis was: Can we facilitate that on PYUSD rails so as not to have the currency conversion, the friction, as well as time?” 

> PayPal completed its first business transaction using PYUSD last year. Stablecoins are currencies designed to track fiat currencies one-to-one. PYUSD is pegged to the US dollar. 

> Additionally, PayPal plans to add PYUSD as an option for global payments through Hyperwallet, a business that helps organizations send mass payments to contractors, freelancers or sellers around the world. PayPal acquired Hyperwallet in 2018 for $400 million. It plans to have PYUSD payouts live in the first half of this year. The business will also allow merchants to settle PayPal checkout transactions in cryptocurrencies by the end of 2025.

Yesterday i bought a put spread on $HIMS after reading there was concern about their fake ozempic and shit, didn't do much research, i hate this company and go short everytime it gives me a chance.

This morning i was happy i did the spread because just put would have yielded just a tiny more but with more risk. (+10k it was at this moment)

But i couldn't close properly the combo and started to be annoyed, I just went to close it leg by let. When i closed the short leg, leaving the 93k Put 50 alone the Voices started whispering and.. i left the pos open to run...

You know the rest, market went tits up, all sea of red, $HIMS went -18٪ to - 26٪ and netted me 74k.

I added a screen of my others pos for transparency almost -20k unlrz.

I played hd/low puts on the belief tax war will make them lower guidance (canadian wood, not my idea, seemed dumb, i liked it).

i went tempus for double pump with nvidia (that filthy hag rug pulled me again) I keep it cause nvidia earning may bring it back from the deads.

However even with the recent 25% drop I believe that they are still grossly overvalued.  
  
I would put them around 30B marketcap at best which would be around 400 a share.

Government spending has fueled AXON to double over the last year but the current administration will be cutting back. Anyone can make taser and body cams, and their SaaS offerings are a joke.

And lastly but most importantly, americans don't give a shit about bitch ass stuff like being responsible and having accountability with tasers and body cams.   


Wish me luck fellas.

  
P.S. They only have monthlys so not quite as YOLO as it could be...

wallstreetbets,A closer look at Microsoft news – buy the AI dip?,1ixzpoh,Dill_Withers1,2025-02-25 11:56:06,41,0.83,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ixzpoh/a_closer_look_at_microsoft_news_buy_the_ai_dip/,"As is usual before NVDA earnings, FUD is being spread about the ‘AI trade.’ I find this situation again reminiscent of the DeepSeek panic which NVDA and other AI plays quickly rebounded from in about a week (see my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1icdu1d/deepseek_training_cost_the_95_mil_difference/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) highlighting the blatant misunderstanding of renting GPUs for $5.6m vs. total cost of ownership for AI infrastructure in $100s of billions).

**The FUD: ‘data center oversupply’**

Headlines have been coming out that Microsoft walking away from a “couple hundred MWs” of datacenter leases (note, this would likely represent <5% of their overall estimated 5 GW installed capacity). Analysts are also insinuating this means there is a larger ‘oversupply’ and therefore AI capital expenditures will be slowing down.

[The Register - Microsoft's drawback on datacenter investment may signal AI demand concerns](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj8jtzHg9-LAxXol-4BHfCRJ4cQxfQBKAB6BAgPEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.com%2F2025%2F02%2F24%2Fdoes_microsoft_pull_back_on%2F&usg=AOvVaw3nXfbntonLATxN5KnPWAzG&opi=89978449)

*“TD Investment bank claims software giant ditched 'at least' 5 land parcels due to potential 'oversupply'”*

 

**The Critique: Dip Buying Opp?**

First off, it is not clear if these MSFT leases are for high-performance compute (GPUs for AI workloads) or traditional non-AI cloud (for things like storage, where demand has been waning). For the sake of argument, let’s assume this was for AI compute.

**Point 1** \- Overall, Microsoft is not slowing down. After the TD report on Friday, Microsoft [reiterated they are not cutting their $80bil capital spending plan for this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-reiterates-plan-to-invest-80-billion-in-ai-.html). So, as they are walking away from a couple hundred MWs of leased capacity, meanwhile they will be building several GWs.

**Point 2** \- In Q4, Microsoft missed cloud revenue targets. On the earnings call, CFO Amy hood noted shortfalls in Q4 performance was due to supply constraints, and the larger capex spend is expected to drive stronger Azure growth. In other words, the revenue miss was a *capacity problem*, not a *demand problem*. So why slow down now? Doesn’t add up.

**Point 3** – Open AI is adding more compute capacity with other partners (Oracle and Softbank). This would represent a ***shift*** in capital spending from Microsoft to others, i.e. this does not indicate an oversupply.

[Microsoft and OpenAI evolve partnership to drive the next phase of AI - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/)

“Microsoft has **approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity**, primarily for research and training of models.”

[OpenAI Stargate Joint Venture Demystified | Microsoft Sore Loser, Does Softbank Have The Capital?, Texas GigaCampus, Winners & Losers – SemiAnalysis](https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/23/openai-stargate-joint-venture-demystified/#microsoft-is-the-biggest-loser)

“**Microsoft is largely left on the sidelines as OpenAI utilizes another infrastructure partner.** As Satya Nadella [stated](https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1882085592135237737?s=19), “all I know is, I’m good for my $80B.” Microsoft’s recent [blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/) stated the facts of the partnership and how Microsoft has a ROFR, but the reality is this is incrementally negative for Microsoft long-term since they were **afraid to take on the risk of this investment.** “

“**Microsoft is shifting some of the capital intensity of its AI initiatives on to Oracle**, but we don’t think this short-term benefit outweighs the long-run potential harm of losing the revenue and control over OpenAI.”

**AI continues advancements:**

Anthropic’s [Claude 3.7](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-7-sonnet-the-first-hybrid-reasoning-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/) was released Monday and is quickly approaching professional human-level coding abilities (70% on SWE bench, which measures agentic coding ability vs. 80% avg. score for a human professional). Open AI’s ChatGPT 4.5 is rumored to be released in the coming weeks as well. These are/will be tangible results in the advancement of these models towards agentic use with addressable markets in the trillions (think remote ‘drop-in’ AI coworker). Further, continued investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will be of paramount importance to national security (maintaining AI supremacy over China).  

**TLDR:** I see this as a dip buying opportunity on AI names & energy. Overreaction from MSFT news. (NVDA, TSM, VRT\*\*, AVGO, MRVL, ANET, CIEN, NBIS, APLD, VST, OKLO, ET, KMI)

\*\*See UBS 11:27 AM ET, 02/25/2025 note on Vertiv: “Our conclusion is the recent sell-off is way overdone, as it implies >30% reduction in data center capacity growth vs. what was priced in just 30 days ago.""

Ready for Jensen to lay down the earnings report on me Wednesday afternoon. The anticipation, the anxiety leading up to it, the buzz around the upcoming report, makes me feel a certain way. But Jensen is calm, cool, and collected. Dropping the earnings report like it’s nothing while looking like a boss in his leather jacket. But it goes much deeper.

Every day I think of Jensen. Every morning I wake up and look at myself in the mirror as I try on my leather jacket wishing I looked as cool as Jensen. I then go to my freshly bought mannequin with my sharpie and practice signing breasts, but painfully know that I’ll never be able to sign breasts quite like how Jensen does. After, I hold up my 4090 in the mirror giving a speech about it pretending like I am presenting at GTC, but willingly know that I don’t have the stage presence that Jensen has when he’s up there trying to summon Thor’s hammer. As I get ready for bed, I walk into my closet and pick another leather jacket, hang it beside my bed, and get ready to repeat the same thing the next day, wishing that one day I will be just like Jensen.

It seems a lot more interesting than $HOOD or $RDDT.

They have a monopoly on gay sex, plus whenever I open the app I get like 50 messages so I know it's gotta be the most active dating app on a per user basis.


I'm not an expert but they had some outstanding warrants that were only redeemable up to like $18, and lo and behold the day they expire the stock finally breaks $19? Interesting.


positions: $GRND 3/21 $20 and $18 calls


Edit: counterpoints:


**""The app sucks to use.""** Valid. That's by design to milk lonely dudes for membership fees. I think Grindr is more robust here than other dating apps because 1. The average guy's chance of getting a response or even some action is way higher than other apps, making the premium membership a better value proposition for the target demographic and 2. The ""high interest"" users that paid users are targeting are not going to be deterred by the current monetization strategy. Of course guys who are trying to honestly use the app are gonna have a bad time. The revenue doesn't come from them and never has. 


**""It's been going up for a while.""** So has every stonk that's worth a shit. They have a roughly $3.5b valuation, making them about 1/3 Match's size. I don't think the two are super comparable for a number of reasons, but I do think their userbase is significantly more resilient. I don't see a world where Grindr is worth less than half of Match for long.


**""You are gay.""** Correct

It was crazy watching the entire market tank last week and JNJ was one of the only stocks to see 2% gains daily.

Picked up some shares a month ago, when it was near the bottom, and just watched how to stock moved. Once I was confident in an upturn, I started buying calls. Just rode it up until what I thought might be the peak today. Even if it keeps running, I’m happy with my gains. I was hoping it would go to 170, but it could go either way at this point so I just sold out.

This was the perfect stock to gain experience in letting the winners run. The stock is not very volatile so I could hold out on some of the down days. But fortunately the down days were very small, but up days were big. And the last week just shot up.

Thanks JNJ. I’m finally in the positive. Now I can start playing with house money!

wallstreetbets,Ivanhoe mines double bottom today. Low IV. Yolo’d in today (IVPAF in Murica),1ixadpd,LokiPokee,2025-02-24 14:20:47,6,0.59,14,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ixadpd,"
Ivanhoe flagship asset is located in Kolwezi, Congo. Currently a rebel army M23 from Rwanda has taken over 2 cities near the border. Goma and Bukavu. Both of these cities are shit holes with millions in population but were overtaken by M23’s minuscule 8000 man army last week. This is what they look like: 10 guys with tiny guns cramming into the back of 15 year old Toyota trucks: https://imgur.com/a/Ed6Rmlo

Ivanhoes asset Kamoa Kakula is a massive copper mine 40% owned by the Chinese. It’s located 1600km away from the conflict zone. These guys trucks wouldn’t even be able to make the drive without breaking down even if they wanted to come after it. Their army is also so caveman/obsolete if there ever was a threat the Chinese could send 1 drone and end the war. All of the copper gets shipped to China. There’s zero chance the operations will be affected by this conflict.

But due to the scare of something happening IVN investors have been selling causing a big dip. The conflict has been happening since the beginning of December leading IVN to dip from $20 to now the $14s. On Feb 3rd IVN dipped to mid $14’s just like today. Today marks a double bottom and on technicals should rebound to $17-18 within 1-2 weeks. IV is super cheap on this stock, a rise to $18 will make most options 5-15x depending what strike you gamble on. The Congo government is also declaring they will fight M23 and retake their cities. News of the conflict being contained to that region will be bullish for scared IVN sellers to buy back in.

Just last week IVN posted q4 financials and made a record $386mil US profit. Annualized is $1.5billion giving it a tiny PE of 8x. A new zinc mine in another region just came online during Q4 and will add another $100mil to Q1 profits as well as a new mega smelter competed at K&K during our current quarter which will add $0.30 profit for every pound of copper sold. It’s trading at only 4x 2026 profits. This is a great stock to go long on as well as short options and the time to enter is now.

wallstreetbets,"In a gold rush, sell shovels. In a period of POTUS-induced volatility, buy IBKR options.",1iwx9kp,Uzunzatu,2025-02-24 03:23:34,88,0.84,35,https://i.redd.it/fa2qjsgdr1le1.jpeg,"Anyone following IBKR over the last year knows that their line goes pretty consistently up. I have made money before by buying ITM options on IBKR dips, so I entered again on Thursday. Was 2k in profit before Friday's mini meltdown but I carried on buying most of the way down. Now it looks like I have a YOLO on my hands.

My rationale is as follows:

IBKR is a good broker, and is taking over from RH as the regards' broker of choice. You don't even have to get in your car or risk getting a restraining order for stalking a cashier (in true WSB style) to find this out. Just count the number of IBKR screenshots posted on here. They used to be rare, now they're very common. 

As well as an increasing number of customers, they make money from commissions, margin loans to degenerates, and paying Fed rate minus .5% to those enjoying a fleeting moment of glory and holding their fat stacks with them. Commissions and margin loans basically means they make money from volatility. This was reiterated in their last earnings report.

Sell everything and go all cash when you see Elon's offspring using the Oval Office as a playpen? IBKR makes money. Cash out US stocks to buy EU defence stocks in a patriotic fervour? IBKR makes money. Go all in with margin on TQQQ calls when the President calls off his own tariff war? IBKR makes money.

They publish monthly metrics so you don't need to wait for earnings for confirmation they are doing well. In January they did well. Metrics for this month will be out early March and I can't imagine they will be bad.

This should get back in the mid 230s before long. IV is relatively low, so I'm holding 15 x 210C for next month's expiry. If this is the beginning of a market downtrend I'm fucked, but I suppose that goes for most of us.

Tl;dr - IBKR is a good broker, is growing anyway, and does especially well in periods of volatility. IBKR's numbers wull be fine, but downside risk is that if SPY keeps drilling I'm gonna get gaped.

wallstreetbets,DD: ET (Energy Transfer - midstream) LEAP opportunities,1iwpboj,rawj5561,2025-02-23 19:42:40,85,0.93,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iwpboj/dd_et_energy_transfer_midstream_leap_opportunities/,"This post is calling out some primo LEAP opportunities for the midstream stock ET.  

I’m loaded with Jan 2026 Calls for the strike price of $22 and $25. This post is a play on the bullish case for domestic US energy/oil.

**Highlights for why you might be interested:**

* Recent agreement reached with a tech company I’ve never heard of: [CloudBurst Data Centers on Feb 10th](https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-and-cloudburst-sign-agreement-natural-gas-supply). This is the first publicly made agreement and a significant precedent for partnerships in midstream at this scale. ET supposedly [“has requests from more than 70 prospective data centers in 12 states.""](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/19/energy-transfer-looks-to-turbocharge-growth-spendi/)  Everyone knows nuclear companies are eventually going to be the standard, but that’s only if the industry can get there in 5+ years. When the OKLO and friends bubble pops, Tech companies will need to be realistic about how to get their energy and pivot to domestic energy sourcing: enter ET  
* Biden banned [new off-shore drilling in the US just before leaving office](https://news.mongabay.com/short-article/president-biden-bans-offshore-oil-and-gas-drilling-for-many-u-s-waters). Why do you think Trump is calling the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America? It’s so that we can be confident drilling in our own backyard again. If this executive order is revered, midstream is positioned to capitalize on any increase of drilling.  
* ET is putting [$5 billion into growth over 2025, up $3 billion from 2024](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/energy-transfer-earnings-growth-2024-sets-up-an-impressive-outlook-2025-27). More growth === more fees === more profit for investors. As well, In their recent Q$ earnings, [ET saw it’s EBITDA grow 8%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/19/energy-transfer-looks-to-turbocharge-growth-spendi/), and forecast a continued increase for the 2025 fiscal year. This is important since EBITDA is the main metric that midstream companies use to grow.  
* ET currently trades at an enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple of about 8.5 times the high end of its 2025 guidance. While its valuation has risen, it's still significantly where it traded before the pandemic.    
* ET [*increased* dividends on their Q4 earnings for fy '24](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/ET/energy-transfer-reports-fourth-quarter-2024-results-and-announces-gh1vgkt2s9sc.html). Take this as you will for confidence on outlook for fy 2025. 
* [Energy demand for AI is still growing in 2025](https://x.com/davidsacks/status/1893341994098860330?s=46), not decreasing. Despite the recent volatility in the AI space, demand for energy/LNG/oil sourced domestically is continuing to rise. 
* Warren Buffet [continues to increase his position in OXY](https://www.investopedia.com/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-grows-stake-in-occidental-petroleum-11678787#:~:text=Warren%20Buffett's%20Berkshire%20Hathaway%20purchased,ownership%20stake%20in%20the%20company.). OXY, while not ET, offers exposure to upstream/midstream/downstream oil. 

Risk/Callouts:  

ET is transparent that is expects a lot of [its growth services to go into service by 2026](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/19/energy-transfer-looks-to-turbocharge-growth-spendi). Depending on the patience as an investor with other opportunities in the market, you might not be rushing to get Call options/positions on this stock. That’s why we’re getting LEAPS for when (not if) future catalysts and growth start getting priced in.

Feb 21 - Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI, Financial) performs a strategic move by issuing $700 million in convertible senior notes. Super Micro Computer finalized the 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2028 with unsecured maturity on July 15, 2028, though the notes become redeemable before term through redemption or conversion or sukuk repurchase. Interest payments for the notes will begin in the first half of July 2025. Super Micro Computer Inc. intends to allocate the funds generated from its $700 million note issuance for corporate expenses, which include building operational working capital to sustain future growth initiatives.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI.

The notes provide noteholders with the option of redemption following March 1, 2026, according to the indenture provisions, while a fundamental change in the company entitles them to demand a repurchase.

It's very simple, I like rocks. When I see rocks, I get excited. So when I saw a picture of the CEO Gerard Barron of TMC holding a Polymetallic Nodule from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean I couldn't help myself and went all in.

Here's the thing, the global industry demands certain metals to transition to ""clean energy"". For this transition, we need a lot of Nickel, Cobalt, Copper, and Manganese for things like stainless steel production, solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries. Luckily, these little rocks that The Metals Company (TMC) is planning to harvest in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) inside their various contract areas have them.

The Metals Company has access to three contract areas in the CCZ. Two of them contain 1.6 billion tons of Polymetallic Nodules. Each wet ton of nodules is worth \~$500 at current metal prices. That's approaching a trillion dollars in metal in just two of the three contract areas.

The CFO goes into detail here:

More details here:

[https://investors.metals.co/news-events/events-and-presentations](https://investors.metals.co/news-events/events-and-presentations)

Since Trump has been elected, he has appointed a lot of very pro mining, and specifically, pro deep sea mining members to his cabinet. Some information on that here:

[https://mailchi.mp/8eea6f13414e/tmc\_jan25\_update-12701606](https://mailchi.mp/8eea6f13414e/tmc_jan25_update-12701606)

The CEO has claimed to be able to extract all 866 million tons of nodules from their NORI contract area over a 23 year period. 37 million tons per year.

Recent event in India where the CEO speaks:

(They discuss ""dark oxygen"" around 9:23:15)

[https://youtu.be/oPIZAKikd48?t=32660](https://youtu.be/oPIZAKikd48?t=32660)

Current capabilities based on their production vessel (The Hidden Gem) are 1.3m tons per year, with plans to upgrade the vessel to 3m tons per year before extraction starts in early 2026.

Revenues to start will be $650m per year, eventually scaling up to $18.5bn per year after a ""few"" years. I'm holding until $69.42 (\~$23.8bn MC).

""If you don't ROCK AND STONE you ain't comin' home"".

TLDR;

I saw a dude with a rock and decided to yolo my life savings into the stock.

What’s up guys?  I’m following up my WMT earnings play with another dip into MRNA.  I follow this stock closely and have posted about it before.  Those that tailed last time made money(although it was a painful hold).  I like MRNA because it is prone to pretty large moves, and options can gain(and lose) value very quickly. Here is why I bought calls on Friday.


1.  The big news Friday that led to a 5% jump in MRNA.   Scientists in China found a covid-like virus in bats studied in a lab.  This is significant because this virus enters the human body through a similar pathway as Covid-19.   The vast majority of coronaviruses cannot infect humans, but SARS Covid-19 and this new virus both use the same receptor to enter human cells and replicate.  This news was fairly fresh on Friday, with only a couple outlets reporting it.  I think that after a weekend of this info spreading, we will see strong buying pressure on MRNA early next week.  


2.  Avian flu is concerns are rising.  The virus is now endemic in cows and cats, showing that it is spreading within mammals.  While this has been happening for a little while and is not really new news, what’s is new is that the current administration is cutting funding for infectious disease study, and likely keeping important information from being published.  The bare minimum is available on the CDC website, a massive difference between now and 2020 when data was published daily.   This is going to get worse, and it is only a matter of time before we see human to human spreading.  When that happens MRNA will double in price, which is why longer dated calls are a good play IMO.  


3.  Big players are buying here.  Bridgewater Associates(founded by Ray Dalio), the largest hedge fund in the world by AUM, just bought 600,000+ shares, Theleme Partners now owns $300 million worth, and Jane Street just upped their holdings to $150 million.  Book value for MRNA is right around $30.  We saw them miss on EPS but beat on revs recently.  That morning, the stock very briefly dropped to $28, but was bought back up to $33 almost instantly.  In my opinion, $30 is the floor.   It may come down and test it again, but I doubt it given the news Friday.   IF MRNA breaks $30 and closes below $30 on significant volume, I will likely abandon this thesis and consider it a lost cause. 


4.  The technicals are very bullish.  There is a significant bullish RSI divergence on both the daily and the weekly(yes I drew a line on the RSI).  MACD is turning up on both time frames as well.  This is the exact same RSI setup that helped me see the WMT pivot last week.  I know it’ll get ragged on here, but it helps me spot reversals so I add it to the list of clues.  


5.  The options chain.  The put/call volume ratio for next week is 0.10.  For those that don’t know, that means 10 times as many call options were traded as put options.  The open interest put/call ratio is 0.65, still very bullish.   The one caveat to the volume is one trader may have entered a large call credit spread, which would be bearish, but it could also be a hedge.  HOWEVER, there will still be about 78,000 open call contracts between $35 and $41 that could act as a magnet.  There are also around 58,000 call options in open interest at the $45 and $50 strikes for March 21.  Those are a bit safer and I will likely roll some of my already purchased weeklies into those. 


6.  Volume.  It’s been elevated since November.  In the early Covid days, MRNA would regularly get 20-40 million share days.  Towards the end of 2021 until Nov 2024, the average day would be between 2-6 million shares or so.  In the last week, volume has not dipped below 10 million, and hit 21 million shares on Friday.  


I think MRNA is gearing up for a move to the upside.  I have $40 and $41 calls expiring this week, but I will roll them to a later date if I think it’s appropriate. Quick note, MRNA tends to run really hard in one direction in the first 10 minutes of trading.  That direction is usually a fake out, and it often reverse very quickly.  Again, it’s prone to very large, very fast moves.   Know your risk tolerance.  If you catch 100% gains at open and want to bail, do it.  If you’re down 50%, don’t panic.  


Two earnings plays that I’m looking at are HD puts(similar theory to my WMT DD) or possibly LOW puts to play for sympathy without the IV crush,  and CLF calls.  


None of this is financial advice.

Because i'm a regarded Aussie, but tendies are tendies. If this strain is half as bad as the RDDT Put guy's timing, CSL's reaches the moon before LUNR.

**Catalysts:** Partnerships with governments, and increased demand for plasma therapies due to a potential public health emergency if this Covid-like virus breaks out of the lab in Wuhan (sound familiar?).

I'm going to attempt to explain to you regards why gold and silver mines print money and critical minerals projects are critically regarded.

**Rare Earths**

Rare earths are not rare! The main payable metal is NdPr Neodymium Praseodymium used for magnets. With Neodymium prices in the toilet due to China doing China things like injecting ammonium sulfate directly into the ground to leach the rare earths in situ, most hard rock projects like MP materials are losing money.

There are some great ionic clay rare earth projects out there with over 2% rare earth oxides but they exist on non freedom exchanges like the TSX and the ASX and are development projects that aren't mining anything yet.

The key issue with rare earths is processing capacity. This will probably get on-shored to the US in the next 5-10 years and China and Lynas Rare Earths will no longer be the only processors. This is why UUUU is the least regarded investment OP listed. DYODD.

**Lithium**

There was never a shortage of lithium, only a shortage of lithium processing capacity. Any deposit under 1% lithium is not going to be economic. Lithium is about as rare as copper. Guys at Exxon are developing direct lithium extraction technologies to extract lithium directly out of saltwater wells in [Arkansas](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/1113_exxonmobil-drilling-first-lithium-well-in-arkansas).

If they figure that out most existing hard rock mines may no longer be economical. Lithium is the most regarded bet. Any decent lithium project worth anything got built in the last few years.

**Gold and Silver**

We are in the beginning of a precious metals bull market. Any regard can see this in the gold chart. Historically silver prices tend to follow gold prices, but silver moons harder than gold does because the average regard is too poor to buy gold.

Gold is what central banks buy when their butt holes start to pucker. And they have been buying gold at record levels recently.

GDX and GDXJ are terrible bets because most gold companies are trash. Barrick was producing 5 million ounces 10 years ago now they're down to 2 million ounces. Nemont did so many acquisitions in the past 20 years ballooning its share count offsetting any kind of rise in profits or production they might have experienced. These companies have ruined the reputation of the mining sector for most institutions and retail investors.

It's best to bet on mid tier producers that are building or developing new mines.

They are supporting NASA’s Artemis program (for exploration, research, building infrastructures and digital lunar communications), and are notably partnered with Nokia to deploy the first cellular network on the Moon during the upcoming IM-2 mission.

Let's now see what happened to their stock price during their first mission.

* February 15, 2024: Intuitive Machines' first Moon mission, IM-1 (Nova-C lunar lander). Over the course of four days since launch date LUNR stock rose \~150%.

Second Lunar Mission is scheduled to launch as soon as Feb 26th, and we may experience a new cycle of strong valorization, starting next week. Especially as we are now facing a one month correction since 24th January that brought the stock from peaks of $25 into current lows of $18, where we see strong support on the EMA 200 in the daily chart.

TL;DR: Expect a strong rise in LUNR stock price next week in anticipation to the Second Lunar Mission launch scheduled to Feb 26th (they may move dates if any unexpected meteorological event happens).

Why is the net profit margin relatively low: 200 of their 255 employees are engineers that R&D this company to perfection. My guess is that this is quite expensive. Droneshield understands: great value comes from great products. And great products bring in great costumers.

Negative: DRO takes on very little debt, to little. Instead they have gradually over the years sold more shares. I would say this should slow down now cash is coming in through sales. 

  
Furthermore they maintain a very healthy balance sheet with 220 million cash balance. Check out their website. Its a piece of art on its own: [https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations](https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations)

I plan to stay in for the long run. But if it moons again like last time I will take profit and step back in when the dust settled.

The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.

Today I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.

**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**

Why does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?

The answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.

[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.

Don’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.

Let me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.

**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**

Alright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.

First, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.

You see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.

If there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.

As if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. 

If you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. 

What does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”

I recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”

By way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.

Here is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:

>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

Trump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.

Furthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\*\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\*\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.

**Part III: Positions**

Where to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.

https://preview.redd.it/gtl426m18rke1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46ae72c3552c0d547b0e3c58f81aa77087fdc82

Why did I pick these? (don't mind Humana, Uber, VST)

>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.

>**LYS** is AU but part of ""The Quad"" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes ""(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.""

>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration

>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).

>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)

>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: ""(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.""

>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.

>**TLOFF** is nickel, partnered with TSLA

>**ABAT** is US lithium batteries supply/recycling

>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.

I'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:

>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so""

* President Trump are planning to tax 25% tariff on chips outside of US, a bubble for Nvidia manufacturing
* Yes yes I know 5000 series releases got sold out in seconds, but it was released on Jan 30, so it's next quarter so it doesn't do shit this quarter yet.

Why you should buy put?

* Insider trading shows that there is a massive sell off, obviously it doesn't say anything much.

* Nvidia tends to sensitive to news, especially world new and fluctuated the most when it comes to news.
* Nvidia main manufacturing is TSMC, which got unlove for our beloved President Trump (https://www.mk.co.kr/en/business/11243062)
* China (in general) wants to compete with chip manufacturing especially with Taiwan (https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2025/02/11/2003831653)
* Recently, Google and Microsoft starts to develop their own chips for their AI, so we are heading to era of independent chip-dependent from Nvidia
* Sure sure, ""yOu sTill nEEd to bUy nVidIa Chips"".From previous earnings, there is a 17% increase in Data Center revenue Q4 2024, a 16% increase in Data Center revenue Q3 2024, and 23% increase in Data Center revenue Q2 2024, and 27% increase in Q1 2024. There is a slow down increase and with a nearest quantum chips release from IQVN, Google, Microsoft, I anticipate that this quarter can still have an increase but not impressive
* So why I think Nvidia chips are stagnant? The investment of research from their previous earnings clearly shows that they don't want to heavily invest in research as much as before --> Chips independent era gonna be coming.

Why you should buy calls?

* Because I buy puts

wallstreetbets,Rivian (RIVN) Earnings Review - Bullish,1iuxffd,DeepFeckinAlpha,2025-02-21 13:08:51,38,0.87,22,https://i.redd.it/cvbglmu19jke1.jpeg,"TLDR: Rivian is a BUY, because it’s cheap  

Post earnings call, Rivian has found gross profit, reducing vehicle production costs by $30k.  

Eyeing the R2 release in a year, they’ve sourced 95% of materials for it at half the cost of R1, seeing growing bargaining power in negotiations while realizing opportunities for production efficiencies.

People are pumped about the R2 release.  

With $7B of cash they are guiding towards a <($2B) loss for 2025 -  

leaving $5B of cash + $3.4B more from VW deal, putting them at a future $8.4B in cash alone for capex and expansion.  

While the DOE loan might see pressure, they will also create **7500 US MANUFACTURING JOBS in Georgia**.  

Killing manufacturing jobs isn’t really aligned with the current admin goals, even as they talk about ICE vehicles and the need to drill more.  

Guidance for ‘25 was conservatively flat given the environment, however -  

With Tesla protests happening and a deep fleet of existing owners, the Tesla to Rivian trade-up is happening in force, which will especially add to R2 demand and existing R1 demand.  

Between R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‘26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  

All of which doesn’t include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.

Rivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.  

Rivian is well capitalized, backed by big players who believe in their position, and most importantly -  

PEOPLE LOVE THEIR PRODUCT.  

In the last year, Rivian is down 15%, while the company position and story becomes better and better.  

Love the trade and upside here!

https://www.energy.gov/lpo/project-horizon

That loan is much needed by RIVN. 

They lose roughly $39,000 per vehicle sold currently, have $5.74B in debt and $7.70B in cash. TTM net income is -$4.75B. 

Once Trump took office, he vowed to “look into” the Rivian loan. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fate-rivian-6-6-billion-174558360.html?guccounter=1

Since Elon Musk is making most of these decisions, and he has shown to clearly bias his own businesses thus far with Tesla and SpaceX, it’s likely that they find a way to cancel this loan. 

If the loan gets cancelled, RIVN will sell off.

Few positive things to know:
1. They have met or beaten every earnings report since they are publicly traded. 
2. The short report is shown to be extremely false.
3. Their clients are Forbes top 100 companies and neither of them left them after the report was published. 
4. Strong insider buying after the short attack. 
5. Company growth is amazing. 
6. Analyst sentiment is extremely positive.

Few negative things to know: 
1. Short attack might still be on, though CEO claims that shorts closed their positions after few days they started the attack. 
2. The stock is extremely reactive to any news. Especially negative news, no matter if they are fake or true. 
3. The stock is extremely reactive on the red market trend.

Probably the worst forward guidance I’ve heard from a saas company in that earrings call. More RIF’s coming to focus on core business, core business is losing paying users and forecasting a continued decline, core business has smaller sales team which will limit ability to monetise user base, dead weight products they have to service that will cause revenue headwinds, need to refinance their debt (they are fucked on that front).

The only “positive” they could point to was a super weird assertion that they are “basically Netflix pre-streaming, when the business was mailing DVD’s” this was said maybe 6 times. 

Directly calling themselves out that they’re in an unsustainable path that’s requires a sidekick shift in the value they bring their users. They think that their AI search tool Dash is the key to future of the company, but then went on to say it will not have any impact towards revenue. It’s a totally delusional stance to have thinking you can turn your declining cloud storage customer base into some hyper growth AI search company.

What impresses me about the company is that have an absolutely ridiculous cadence of contracts announcements. We are talking new contracts week after week after week.

As far as valuation goes, it stacks of pretty damn nice. For example, far better grow and lower ev / sales multiple compared to it's closest peer PL.

Back in the day they had a strategic partnership with PLTR. Not notably sure if it is still ongoing:

In sum, I think BKSY occupies a really interesting niche (high res, low latency imagery) that will likely be able to command really nice margins over time. And they have the benefit of a good liquidity and positive growth, so probably don't need to worry about being hammered by financing - as is the typical case with satellite companies - all that much.

I am rolling with a good slug of commons, and some calls for extra juice.

stocks,Nvidia announces Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin AI chips,1jecbuv,Puginator,2025-03-18 14:40:23,33,0.97,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jecbuv/nvidia_announces_blackwell_ultra_and_vera_rubin/,"Nvidia announced new chips for building and deploying artificial intelligence models at its annual GTC conference on Tuesday. 

CEO Jensen Huang revealed Blackwell Ultra, a family of chips shipping in the second half of this year, as well as Vera Rubin, the company’s next-generation graphics processing unit, or GPU, that is expected to ship in 2026.

Nvidia’s sales are up more than sixfold since its business was transformed by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. That’s because its “big GPUs” have most of the market for developing advanced AI, a process called training.

Software developers and investors are closely watching the company’s new chips to see if they offer enough additional performance and efficiency to convince the company’s biggest end customers — cloud companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon — to continue spending billions of dollars to build data centers based around Nvidia chips.

Tuesday’s announcements are also a test of Nvidia’s new annual release cadence. The company is striving to announce new chips on an every-year basis. Before the AI boom, Nvidia released new chips every other year. 

The GTC conference in San Jose, California, is also a show of strength for Nvidia. 

The event, Nvidia’s second in-person conference since the pandemic, is expected to have 25,000 attendees and hundreds of companies discussing the ways they use the company’s hardware for AI. That includes Waymo, Microsoft and Ford, among others. 

Nvidia will also showcase its other products and services at the event. 

For example, Nvidia announced new laptops and desktops using its chips, including two AI-focused PCs that will be able to run large AI models such as Llama or DeepSeek. The company also announced updates to its networking parts for tying hundreds or thousands of GPUs together so they work as one.

Vera Rubin

Nvidia said on Tuesday that it expects to start shipping systems on its next-generation GPU family in the second half of 2026. 

The system has two main components: a CPU, called Vera, and a new GPU design, called Rubin. It’s named after astronomer Vera Rubin.

Vera is Nvidia’s first custom CPU design, the company said, and it’s based on a core design they’ve named Olympus. 

Previously when it needed CPUs, Nvidia used an off-the-shelf design from Arm. Companies that have developed custom Arm core designs, such as Qualcomm and Apple, say that they can be more tailored and unlock better performance.

The custom Vera design will be twice as fast as the CPU used in last year’s Grace Blackwell chips, the company said. 

When paired with Vera, Rubin can manage 50 petaflops while doing inference, more than double the 20 petaflops for the company’s current Blackwell chips. Rubin can also support as much as 288 gigabytes of fast memory, which is one of the core specs that AI developers watch.

Nvidia is also making a change to what it calls a GPU. Rubin is actually two GPUs, Nvidia said. 

The Blackwell GPU, which is currently on the market, is actually two separate chips that were assembled together and made to work as one chip.

Starting with Rubin, Nvidia will say that when it combines two or more dies to make a single chip, it will refer to them as separate GPUs. In the second half of 2027, Nvidia plans to release a “Rubin Next” chip that combines four dies to make a single chip, doubling the speed of Rubin, and it will refer to that as four GPUs.

Nvidia said that will come in a rack called Vera Rubin NVL144. Previous versions of Nvidia’s rack were called NVL72.

Blackwell Ultra

Nvidia also announced new versions of its Blackwell family of chips that it calls Blackwell Ultra.

That chip will be able to produce more tokens per second, which means that the chip can generate more content in the same amount of time as its predecessor, Nvidia said in a briefing.

Nvidia says that means that cloud providers can use Blackwell Ultra to offer a premium AI service for time-sensitive applications, allowing them to make as much as 50 times the revenue from the new chips as the Hopper generation, which shipped in 2023.

Blackwell Ultra will come in a version with two paired to an Nvidia Arm CPU, called GB300, and a version with just the GPU, called B300. It will also come in versions with eight GPUs in a single server blade and a rack version with 72 Blackwell chips.

The top four cloud companies have deployed three times the number of Blackwell chips as Hopper chips, Nvidia said.

DeepSeek

China’s DeepSeek R1 model may have scared Nvidia investors when it was released in January, but Nvidia has embraced the software. The chipmaker will use the model to benchmark several of its new products.

Many AI observers said that DeepSeek’s model, which reportedly required fewer chips than models made in the U.S., threatened Nvidia’s business.

But Huang said earlier this year that DeepSeek was actually a good sign for Nvidia. That’s because DeepSeek uses a process called “reasoning,” which requires more computing power to provide users better answers. 

The new Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin chips are better for reasoning models, Nvidia said. 

It’s developed its chips to more efficiently do inference, so when new reasoning models require more computing power at the time of deployment, Nvidia’s chips will be able to handle it.

“In the last 2-3 years, a major breakthrough happened, a fundamental advance in artificial intelligence happened, we call it agentic AI,” Huang said. “It can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem.”

stocks,"Tesla board members, executive sell off over $100 million of stock in recent weeks",1jeb0sq,Puginator,2025-03-18 13:47:30,341,0.96,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeb0sq/tesla_board_members_executive_sell_off_over_100/,"As Tesla stock has fallen in recent weeks, members of the board and an executive at Elon Musk's company have been selling off millions of dollars in stock, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Together, four top officers at the company have offloaded over $100 million in shares since early February.

Last week, longtime Musk ally James Murdoch -- the estranged son of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch and a board member since 2017 -- became the latest to do so, exercising a stock option and selling shares worth approximately $13 million, according to an SEC filing. The sale took place on March 10, coinciding with the stock's largest single-day decline in five years.

According to one filing, the shares were sold ""to cover the exercise price relating to the exercise of stock options to purchase 531,787 shares, which are scheduled to expire in 2025.""

Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, who also sits on the board, unloaded 75,000 shares worth approximately $27 million last month, according to a filing.

The chairman of the board, Robyn Denholm, has offloaded more than $75 million dollars worth of shares in two transactions in the past five weeks, federal filings show. The selloffs made by Denholm came as part of a predetermined sales plan.

A number of board members and executives made similar moves in November and December. But the recent sales come at a tumultuous time for Tesla, with the stock falling nearly 50% from a peak in mid-December. The company's shares have suffered most of those losses since President Donald Trump took office and Musk began his controversial governmental cost-cutting efforts as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.

""Whenever insiders, including directors, are selling shares, it's not a positive signal,"" Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News.

However, Ritter added, an exception applies to the predetermined sales plan adopted by Denholm in July 2024, which marks a routine effort to avoid the perception an officer unloaded shares based on inside information.

""Filing a plan months ago to sell some of those shares over time is common,"" Ritter said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Seth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar who studies the electric vehicle industry, said some of the stock sales may owe to personal financial choices made by individual officers.

""While a sale doesn't necessarily mean an executive or board member feels negatively about a company's outlook, it could mean they think the stock is at a fair price or even overvalued,"" Goldstein said.

The share selloffs made by board members and executives totaled about $118 million, but the transactions often came after the individuals exercised stock options, the costs of which totaled about $16 million. The officers ended up with a profit of just over $100 million.

ABC News previously reported on concerns from shareholders and pension funds, some of whom have called on Musk to turn his attention back from slashing government spending to running his car company.

Tesla Chief Financial officer Vaibhav Taneja also sold off shares totaling more than $5 million over recent weeks. Some of those transactions came as part of predetermined sales plans, but a transaction earlier this month did not stem from a scheduled sale.

> European weapons manufacturers from Thyssenkrupp AG to BAE Systems Plc and smaller drone makers stand to gain the most from Germany’s massive defense-spending splurge, according people familiar with the matter, after comments by President Donald Trump raised doubts about the US’s commitment to transatlantic cooperation.
> 
> At the top of Berlin’s shopping list are six F127 battleships from Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems valued at more than €15 billion ($16.4 billion), and 20 added Eurofighter jets from BAE and its partners worth some €3 billion, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the procurement plans aren’t public.
> 
> The emphasis on European-made gear marks a departure from Germany’s previous €100 billion splurge in 2022. A strong “Buy American” component in that debt-financed deal, orchestrated by outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, led to orders for 35 F-35 fighter jets, 60 Chinook transport helicopters made by Boeing Co. and Patriot air-defense systems.
> 
> German lawmakers this week are expected to pass sweeping changes to the constitution that will remove borrowing restriction for defense spending in excess of 1% of gross domestic product, or roughly €45 billion ($49 billion). As most of the €100 billion from the special fund to modernize the Bundeswehr armed forces is either spent or earmarked, the new legislation will open the flood gates for additional defense procurement projects of unprecedented scale.
> 
> European defense-focused stocks have been among the biggest gainers this year as governments make a more concerted push to increase their military budgets and seek to procure more from their home region. US arms shipments still make up the majority of exports to NATO countries, meaning Europe has to catch up if it wants to gain a bigger share of the investments.
> 
> Germany’s latest spending plans have been influenced by signs that the US will be a less-reliable partner in Europe’s defense, after the returning US president briefly stopped arms shipments to Ukraine, and threatened
> not to help NATO allies if they don’t spend more on defense. His close adviser, Elon Musk, has suggested exiting the post-World War security alliance.
> 
> Germany’s defense ministry is poised to start negotiations with Thyssenkrupp Marine to buy six more of the next-generation Fregatte 127 to replace three anti-aircraft frigates of the so-called Saxony class from 2035 onwards, according to the people.
> The Thyssenkrupp unit formed a joint venture last year with domestic shipbuilder Naval Vessels Lürssen to pitch for the F127 order. The deal, which could even surpass the targeted price tag of €15 billion, is likely to be passed by budget lawmakers in the second half of this year, the people added.
> 
> A defense ministry spokesman declined to comment.
> 
> Another big order will be the purchase of 20 added Eurofighter jets in a contract worth up to €3 billion, the people said. The Eurofighter is made by a partnership led by Britain’s BAE, Franco-German aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE and Italy’s Leonardo SpA.
> 
> Scholz announced the intention for the purchase in a speech at the Berlin air show in June 2024, but the order so far was not executed due to disagreements over spending priorities in the outgoing coalition.
> 
> **Shifting Priorities**
> 
> Some lawmakers had argued that Germany shouldn’t invest too much in fighter jets, after the €10 billion purchase of the 35 Lockheed Martin Corp. F35s in 2022 ate up roughly one 10th of the first special fund.
> 
> With budget constraints soon to be lifted, Berlin will now push ahead with the Eurofighter order to balance out its military procurement and put a bigger emphasis on European manufacturers, the people said. In 2020, Germany placed an order for 38 Eurofighter jets worth €5.5 billion.
> 
> Germany also plans to invest several billion euros into the modernization of its military satellite infrastructure, the people said. One beneficiary could be OHB SE, the Bremen-based manufacturer that won a €2.1 billion German order last year.
> 
> Other spending targets include hundred of millions of euros for artillery ammunition, according to the people, including by exercising options on existing contracts with Germany’s Rheinmetall AG and others. Germany also plans more investments in air defense, after large parts of the first fund were spent to buy Iris-T systems from Bavaria-based Diehl, Patriot systems from the US and Arrow 3 from Israel and the US, the people added.

""German lawmakers have voted to allow a huge increase in defence and infrastructure spending - a seismic shift for the country that could reshape European defence.

A two-thirds majority of Bundestag parliamentarians, required for the change, approved the vote on Tuesday.

The law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules, and create a €500bn ($547bn; £420bn) infrastructure fund.

This vote is a historic move for traditionally debt-shy Germany, and could be hugely significant for Europe, as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds on, and after US President Donald Trump signalled an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.

The deal, which will be Google’s largest-ever acquisition, will improve its cloud security offering in a world of advancing artificial intelligence and cybersecurity threats. Wiz will become a part of the company’s cloud business. Google said it expects to close the deal in 2026.

“Google Cloud is a leader in cloud infrastructure, with deep AI expertise and a track record of industry-leading security innovation,” Google said in a release. “Bringing all this to Wiz will help make their solutions even better and more scalable, benefiting customers and partners across all major clouds.”

The acquisition comes after CNBC reported in July that Wiz had walked away from a potential $23 billion acquisition by Google and announced to employees that it would pursue an initial public offering instead.

“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport wrote to employees in a July memo obtained by CNBC. At the time, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC that Wiz walked away from the deal in part due to antitrust and investor concerns.

Before talks with Google were reported, Wiz had set its sights on two goals: an IPO and $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. In the memo at the time, Rappaport wrote that the company would pursue those milestones.

Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown rapidly under Rappaport, with the company hitting $100 million in annual recurring revenue after just 18 months. The company’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response, a portfolio that’s appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft, which also sells security software.

“Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company,” Rappaport said in a blog post Tuesday.

Google has a long history in dealmaking and snatching up smaller companies to broaden its offerings to customers. Its largest deal before Wiz was the $12.5 billion acquisition of hardware marker Motorola in 2012. Two years later, the company sold some assets to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. Google has also made cybersecurity acquisitions in the past, paying $5.4 billion for Mandiant in 2022.

Wiz’s products will still work on competitor platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, the companies said. The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday that the companies were in advanced discussions.

While the agreement may still draw government scrutiny, many on Wall Street have been hopeful that President Donald Trump’s new White House administration will be more amenable to tech industry deals. Alphabet is currently battling an antitrust suit over its online search dominance.

We're down close to 50% since post-election highs and we've had even more bad news yesterday due to the video showing the limitation of non-LIDAR cars.

stocks,Games Workshop Stock: Is Warhammer worth more than Star Wars when acquired by Disney?,1je3mot,JCRUZ_z,2025-03-18 08:21:12,33,0.69,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1je3mot/games_workshop_stock_is_warhammer_worth_more_than/,"This post is in relation to Games Workshop (LON: GAW), the \~£4.66 billion (\~$5.93B USD) tabletop gaming titan behind Warhammer.

My thesis: Warhammer’s universe, intellectual property (IP) and ecosystem are worth *more* than GAW’s current market cap *and* what Disney paid for Star Wars in 2012 ($4.05B, or $5.54B in 2025 dollars).

I know this might sound bold. One can say that Warhammer’s a niche , not a mainstream beast like Star Wars was. However, as someone that's been closely monitoring latest developments of Warhammer in social media and considering an almost 50 years of lore, a rabid fanbase, and catalysts like Henry Cavill’s Amazon series, this could be a sleeper hit the market’s undervaluing.

Let’s break it down.

GAW is the king of tabletop wargaming, crafting Warhammer universes—*40k* (grimdark sci-fi), *Age of Sigmar* (fantasy), and *The Old World* (retro fantasy). Founded in 1975 by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone with *Owl and Weasel*—a newsletter that became *White Dwarf* in 1977—it’s been building lore for 50 years. Today, it’s a £145/share stock with:

* **Market Cap**: £4.66B ($5.93B).
* **Revenue (2024)**: £577.5M ($735M), up 15.6% CAGR over 5 years.
* **Margins**: 71% gross, 41% operating, 30% net—insanely efficient.
* **Cash**: £125.8M, net debt negative (-£79.4M).
* **P/E**: 27.1—pricey, but growth justifies it.

Warhammer’s niche: 1-2M players dropping $200-500/year on minis, paints, and books. It’s not Disney’s scale, but it’s a moat—high-margin, loyal, and sticky.

# The Thesis: Warhammer’s IP is worth more than $5.9B (and Star Wars’ 2012 Price). GAW’s $5.9B cap reflects a tabletop business, but Warhammer’s IP (its lore, brand, and potential) could fetch $9-10B if sold to a Disney/Amazon/Netflix. (*)

*\[\*Edit: I am just trying to* ***value*** *WH's IP and $GAW, not saying I want it to be sold or anything.\]*

Why?

It’s a 50-year universe with untapped multimedia juice, and it’s firing on all cylinders in 2025. Let’s compare:

* **Disney’s Star Wars Deal**: $4.05B in 2012 ($5.54B today) got Lucasfilm—six films, $4.4B box office, $20B in merchandise, 35 years of lore. Disney turned it into $12B+ by 2024.
* **Warhammer Today**: No films (yet), but $735M revenue, 50 years of history and a lore deeper than Star Wars—10,000 years of *40k*, Chaos Gods, Space Marines, plus *Old World* nostalgia. Licensing’s just $38M—5% of revenue—but it’s a powder keg.

**Valuation Math**:

* Core revenue ($735M) x 8 (media IP multiple) = $5.88B.
* Licensing upside ($500M/year from films/TV, Star Wars-scale) x 5 = $2.5B.
* 50-year brand premium = $1-2B.
* **Total**: $9-10B—above GAW’s cap and Star Wars’ 2012 price.

Crazy? Maybe. But Warhammer’s fans are deep into it. Warhammer’s got potential.

# Why Now? 2025 is lighting up:

1. **Warhammer 40k 10th Edition**:
   * Launched June 2023, drove 10.8% core revenue growth in 2024 ($490M). Half-year to Dec 2024: 16.4% up ($307.5M).
   * X buzz (Q1 2025): “warhammer"" traffic’s 12-15M/month, up 10-20% from Q4 2024.
   * Potential: $75M/year growth through 2026.
2. **Henry Cavill’s Amazon Series**:
   * Deal locked Dec 2024: Cavill stars/produces a *40k* cinematic universe.
   * Licensing ($38M now) could double to $76M by 2027, with $40M+ indirect sales if 200K newbies buy armies.
3. **The Old World Resurgence**:
   * Jan 2024 launch, new faction drops (and rumours regarding Cathay).
   * People +30 are getting back to Warhammer. Veterans spending $50-250/army per year
4. **Hachette’s Combat Patrol**:
   * Launched Sept 2024 (UK), Jan 2025 (Spain via Salvat). Weekly mag with minis hooks newbies.
   * Launched in US too.

# Warhammer vs. Star Wars?

Warhammer’s no Star Wars, yet. Star Wars had mass appeal; Warhammer’s a cult with 1-2M players. But:

* **Lore**: 50 years, denser than Star Wars’ 35 in 2012. *Black Library* churns 20+ novels/year—*Horus Heresy* alone is 60+ books.
* **Fanbase**: Smaller but fanatic—players co-create (painting, campaigns). Star Wars sold toys; Warhammer sells a lifestyle.
* **Upside**: Star Wars had films in the can; Warhammer’s a blank slate. Cavill’s series could be its *Force Awakens*.

Some say Warhammer's too niche. I say it has a potential future mass craze.

$9-10B is what a buyer pays for potential, not just today’s market cap.

* **Now**: £145, P/E 27, 4.2% dividend yield. Fair value: £150-160 (EPS $5.35 to $6).
* **Bull Case**: Revenue hits $850M by 2027 (Cavill, *Old World*), EPS $9, P/E 25 = £225—50% upside.
* **Buyout**: A $9B bid spins the IP to Amazon, triples licensing in 5 years.

Risks? Cavill flops, *Old World* fades—growth slows to 5%, stock stalls at £150. But GAW’s 67% ROIC and monopoly scream resilience IMO.

# Thank you in advance for your feedback on my comparison of Warhammer to Star Wars.

>Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, shared the following safety update related to ELEVIDYS (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl), the only approved gene therapy in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We are profoundly saddened to share that a young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has passed away following treatment with ELEVIDYS, having suffered acute liver failure. Acute liver injury is a known possible side effect of ELEVIDYS and other AAV-mediated gene therapies and is highlighted in the prescribing information. Although it is not a new safety signal and the benefit-risk of ELEVIDYS remains positive, acute liver failure (ALF) leading to death represents a severity of acute liver injury not previously reported for ELEVIDYS, which to date has been used to treat more than 800 patients in clinical trials or as a prescribed therapy.

>In addition, testing revealed this patient had a recent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection which was identified by the treating physician as a possible contributing factor. CMV can infect and damage the liver, a condition known as CMV hepatitis.

>Patient safety and well-being are Sarepta’s top priority. We continue to gather and analyze the information from this event. The event has been reported to the relevant health authorities and Sarepta intends to update the prescribing information to appropriately represent this event. We have also reported the event to ELEVIDYS clinical study investigators and prescribing physicians.

>ELEVIDYS (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl) is a single-dose, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene transfer therapy for intravenous infusion designed to address the underlying genetic cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy – mutations or changes in the DMD gene that result in the lack of dystrophin protein – through the delivery of a transgene that codes for the targeted production of ELEVIDYS micro-dystrophin in skeletal muscle.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Shares of Australian shipbuilder Austal Ltd. climbed after a unit of Hanwha Aerospace Co. became a substantial shareholder in the company, as the Korean defense firm aims to bolster its reach.

Austal’s stock rose as much as 9.7% in Sydney trading on Tuesday, its largest jump since Feb. 21, after a subsidiary of Hanwha acquired a 9.9% stake in the firm. The Korean company also applied to the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board to increase its holding to 19.9%, it said in a statement.

Hanwha purchased 41.2 million Austal shares at A$4.45 per share, according to an exchange statement, a 16% premium from Monday’s close.

The move is part of an effort by the Asian defense giant to expand its presence in the region, with the sector receiving renewed interest from investors amid expectations of revenue boosts from increased military expenditure globally. Hanwha Aerospace’s stock has more than doubled this year and is one of the top gainers on Asia’s equity benchmark.

Hanwha unsuccessfully attempted to buy the Australian company last year. In April, the Korean firm said no further discussions were underway, though it was working to continue talks with Austal’s management and board on its acquisition proposal.

> Alphabet Inc. is in talks to purchase the cloud security company Wiz for $33 billion, restarting deal discussions that were called off last summer after extended negotiations, according to people familiar with the matter. 

> The deal, which could be announced as soon as Tuesday, would bolster the cybersecurity offerings for Alphabet’s Google Cloud and provide it with a crucial marketing boost to compete against its larger cloud competitors, Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.’s Azure.

> For Wiz, the deal represents a reversal after the company turned down Alphabet’s $23 billion offer last July, sticking instead with a plan to remain independent and eventually pursue an initial public offering. Wiz and its investors balked at the deal in part because of worries of a protracted regulatory approval process, with competition authorities in the US and Europe focusing on the tech sector for its economic sway and market power. 

> Chief Executive Officer Assaf Rappaport, who described last year’s offer as “humbling,” also said he relished the idea of growing Wiz into an independent cybersecurity giant, to compete against the likes of CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Palo Alto Networks.

Some information about Poppi, the acquisition target.**

\- Founded in 2018 by a couple, they reported upwards of $100 million in sales in 2024. Even if we round up to $150 million in sales, Pepsi would be paying a 13x multiple on top line revenue not net profit. Realistically **19.5x top line revenue** on the $100 million reported if we don't use the rounded up $150 million figure.

\- The company previously appeared on Shark Tank and sold 25% of the business to Rohan Oza for a $400,000 investment. Rohan Oza is a businessman known for his success in bringing drink brands such as Vita Coco and Vitaminwater to market

\- The company has a wide range of marketing partnerships with celebrities including Post Malone, Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Billie Eilish, Russell Westbrook, Jennifer Lopez and Olivia Munn

\- Poppi was previously sued in California class action lawsuit for misleading consumers about the health benefits of their drinks. With only 2g of fiber, a consumer would have to drink 4+ cans to ""realize any potential health benefits""

**Interested to hear what people think about this acquisition.**

\- Is Poppi overvalued and did Pepsi overpay?

\- Should Pepsi have built the internal capabilities to build a brand like this rather than acquiring? Does acquiring show a lack of direction and vision by management? It's hard to imagine that with Pepsi's scale in manufacturing, marketing, retail partnerships, etc.  it have cost more than $1.95 billion to make a competing offering that could reach $100 million in sales within 6 years.

\- Naturally my next thought was, given the above on valuation, is the Poppi brand worth almost $2 billion? Maybe it's not the sales they are after, but the formulation, the brand, or the marketing partnerships.

\- Will Pepsi change the formula, leading to turning off long time customers?

If there is an interest rate drop then we have bottomed and in for another bull run.

There is a prevailing theory, especially among the MAGA crowd, that Trump was playing 4D chess and tanking the market on purpose to get the Fed to drop rates, fulfilling a campaign promise and allowing Trump to refinance a large portion of the government debt at lower rates. I think most levelheaded investors don’t thing this is true. While I don’t agree with the hypothesis, we know that short-term moves in the market are generally not based on fundamentals. 

I also think that if Powell (edited) doesn’t drop rates (which is the expectation) then the next social media post that Trump makes will be something along the lines of “Powell needs to be fired” and that will add more uncertainty to the market. If anything, we mostly like Powell because he’s been so transparent. Do we know what a Trump appointed Fed chair would do?

Edit - in case I wasn’t clear enough. I don’t think the Fed will drop rates. But I do think Trump will make a fuss about it and suggest firing Powell. And the toddler fit he will throw will tank the markets.

>The retail report largely encompasses spending on goods, which is especially relevant now as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on a swath of imports from major trading partners — likely driving up prices. Economists have been marking down growth estimates in recent weeks.

Jerome Powell faces a tricky task this week of both assuring investors the economy remains on solid footing while also conveying policymakers stand ready to step in if necessary.

Even as the Federal Reserve chair has touted US resilience, uneasiness sparked by President Donald Trump’s rapidly escalating trade war has sent stocks tumbling over the past month. Bond yields are down, too, as is consumer sentiment as worries about the economic outlook mount.

“Powell needs to give some sort of a signal that they’re watching it,” said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. While the Fed chief will likely make it clear that officials don’t target the stock market, they can’t ignore the recent slide, he warned.

The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates steady when they meet March 18-19, but traders now see high odds of three rate cuts this year, most likely beginning in June. Economists generally expect two reductions, similar to what forecasters foresee policymakers’ updated projections to show Wednesday. 

Some investors caution that if officials continue to signal only two reductions in 2025, it becomes all the more important for the Fed chief to emphasize the central bank’s willingness to adjust borrowing costs if the labor market stumbles. 

“At the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,” said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. “But clearly they can’t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.” 

On top of the escalating and ever-changing tariff threats toward America’s largest trading partners, the Trump administration hasn’t done much to downplay recession risks. The president said March 9 that the US economy faces a “period of transition,” and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the US and markets are in need of a “detox.” ",0,,2025-03-16,0.4215,0.2732,0.0,-0.640400230884552,0.75,0.25,0.384425,-0.160100057721138,0.11216247113943101,55.608123556971556,positive

stocks,What happened to Ulta and should you look at it now?,1jcmp9j,ElevatorPitchGuy,2025-03-16 10:30:32,4,0.55,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jcmp9j/what_happened_to_ulta_and_should_you_look_at_it/,"Seeing Ulta’s stock movement and wondering what’s happening? Here’s a breakdown of how the company has evolved since COVID and what challenges/opportunities lie ahead.

# Pre-COVID (2016-2019): Strong Growth, but Slowing Momentum

* Looking at the 2016-2019 period the company had grown tremendously its store base getting to over 1,000 stores in the US, a doubling of footprint in five years. As a result, comparable sales (sales made only in stores already opened the previous years) were starting to normalize as incremental stores were generating less footfall and the ramp-up of opened stores was getting close to their optimal productivity. Ulta was on the way to maturing gracefully.

# COVID Bust & Boom: The Unexpected Turn

* COVID-19 triggered a wave of “boom and bust” scenarios across various industries. Companies like ZoomInfo and Domino's Pizza experienced significant sales increases during the pandemic, only to face normalization as the lock-downs ended. In contrast, Ulta went through the opposite trend: a bust followed by a boom, alongside sectors like hotels and spirits. Initially, the pandemic posed an existential threat to retailers like Ulta when no one could shop in stops anymore. However, as consumers found themselves with extra disposable income and a higher focus on self-care, Ulta capitalized on this shift, including through their relaunched e-commerce platform, leading to a remarkable rebound in comparable sales that surpassed pre-COVID levels.

# Normalization & The Sephora@Kohl’s Threat

* Under normal circumstances, we would have expected comparable sales to come down with a few weak quarters and then return to mid-to-high-single-digit industry growth post-COVID. However, in 2021, Sephora, the high-end beauty retailer owned by LVMH, launched an aggressive expansion by opening stores within Kohl’s stores, similar to Ulta's partnership with Target. Historically, Sephora had limited U.S. locations, primarily in city centers and airports. By leveraging Kohl’s locations, they targeted the same customer base as Ulta, attracting shoppers drawn to Sephora's ""prestige"" image despite an overall very similar product offering. Over the course of 3 years, Sephora opened 1,000 stores which are generating USD 1.8bn of revenue in 2024. Ulta admitted that 90% of their own stores had been impacted by new competitors' openings and that they had lost market shares.n.

# So, Is Ulta a Buy?

✅ **Positives:**

* Ulta has an impressive history of growth, disciplined capital allocation, generous returns to shareholders and very little debt (0.7x ND/EBITDA 2024). They are participating in one of my favorite categories: Beauty, which has a track record of sustainably growing mid single digit p.a. globally (see bonus chart at the end) and they have a strong brand, impressive loyalty program, and great store locations.

❌ **Concerns:**

* On the other hand, it is an asset-heavy business with limited scalability once stores reach optimum productivity, challenges in the online channel, and no significant international growth to date (Mexico is not yet live). They are being challenged by a very strong franchise with Sephora@Kohl’s, backed by deep-pocketed LVMH. In online they also face Amazon developing brand shops in prestige beauty with Estée Lauder.

# Valuation & Takeaway

* If consensus estimates hold with growth over +4% p.a. N3Y and end EBIT margin at 12.2%, with multiple remaining at 16x P/E NTM returns would be well in excess of 10% p.a. However, if growth remains weak on the back of Sephora (still targeting +11% growth in 2025 according to Kohl's reporting) and margins fail to expand beyond 12%, then its goes down.

There, I made an argument why markets were overpriced due to valuations and the actions of the current administration.

I am still worried, and I'm wondering what are the counter-arguments. 

1. Valuations are still high. 
2. Trump admin and Musk are pushing austerity via spending cuts/mass layoffs. 
3. Unstable tariff policy. Companies and consumers can't plan ahead. April 2 is coming. More chaos or clarity?
4. Soft data has been terrible. 
5. High-frequency and corporate data (travel, retail) all point to a rapidly deteriorating consumer. 

All of that makes me worried we are headed for a recession. Banks seem to agree and have upped their forecasts for one. Three months ago this would have been laughable. 

Granted, this can all change on a tweet. The trump team can pivot, make tariffs more clear & targeted, and Doge can become more work and less theater. Then, we can get to beneficial tax policies & deregulation.

I'm concerned that's not gonna happen. 

I'm concerned that Trump tariffs wont make companies move to the US & create jobs as Trump, Lutnick, and Bessent think they will. I'm concerned that people will get fired and become more poor, things will get more expensive, and Trump team will have nothing to show for it. 


Now, to positioning & stocks:

I've been buying things that will benefit from protectionist policies, like INTC and X. I've also bought the dip on several big tech names & then sold them on Friday after the rally. Why? Take Nvidia, for example. Great company, but if chips aren't excluded from tariffs, then Nvidia's profit margins would get slashed. So would the valuation.

There’s obviously the extremes, like Citadel’s millisecond level high frequency trading or Warren Buffet’s multi-decade long investments.

I was wondering how long most of you hold your stocks. Do you buy them mostly after speculation that they will go up, and hold them for a few days to weeks or months trying to time the market? Or perhaps you try to find stocks with strong growth catalysts like consistent year over year EPS or ROE, combined with the a few year time horizon on the company’s business activities.

Or do you look at it very long term, trying to find undervalued stocks that you believe the market will eventually the potential of? Whether months, years or decades, you try to find stocks that you believe the market will eventually value correctly.

Historical data backs this up: 24 of the 30 best trading days in the last 30 years happened after major downturns dominated headlines.

Why? Let’s break it down:

Market selloffs act as a cleansing mechanism, forcing weak hands and overleveraged traders to liquidate. As panic peaks—what traders call capitulation—patient, strategic investors step in to seize discounted opportunities.

Right now, we’re in one of those moments, just as a massive Fed meeting kicks off this upcoming Wednesday. The market has been in a three-week freefall. Part of that is now being shown to be attributed to over leveraged hedge funds getting wiped out in crowded positions. 
Could their timing be any worse? I’ve never seen hedge funds (and CTAs apparently) get steam rolled like that! 

I thought they were the smart money? All the while, the following items just happened: 

✅ The largest spending bill in U.S. history was just announced.
✅ Inflation is finally stabilizing.
✅ Interest rates are near 52-week lows.
✅ Deregulation is sweeping through multiple industries reducing legal costs and overhead 
✅ Tax cuts are now on their way to being passed including no tax on tips, no tax on over time, etc etc

Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

stocks,Why $RDDT Is A Must Have Stock,1jc0zhg,Sad_Chest1484,2025-03-15 13:58:22,0,0.39,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jc0zhg/why_rddt_is_a_must_have_stock/,"Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.

Let's start with the fundamentals:

1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.
2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.
3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.
4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% in QoQ. This is great for any share holder.
5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.
6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.
7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.

\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.

8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.

Downside / Bear bases:

1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.
2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how ""clean"" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.
3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.
4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.

Having said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.

Any dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%.

As an investor, the question arises how much growth is possible for a company that relies so heavily on volunteer labor that is not closely monitored. Via moderation the platform in some instances becomes a ""publisher"", which removes legal protections for the site's content.

The issue is not so much weird and arbitrary moderation which users unfortunately encounter a bit too often (not on this sub...) but rather types of moderation that create legal vulnerabilities for the company. As we know RDDT is protected by Section 230 from user generated content. However, when user generated content is shaped by RDDT the nature of these protections change. Here is a hypothetical example (but one that reflects things that actually occur on the site);

Let's say a user promotes a false rumor about Taylor Swift--for example that part of her song writing process is getting in the zone by abusing pregnant, disabled puppies. As a post the only person with legal vulnerability is the user, even if the moderator/site passively fails to remove it.

On the other hand, let's say other users who see this false rumor and aim to disprove it are disciplined by the moderators (who share the first users hate of Taylor Swift)--for instance, issuing bans to users who challenge the original user or present contradictory information. At that point the role of RDDT and its moderators is no longer passive but is taking active steps to promote a false rumor against Ms. Swift. That moderator becomes legally liable in the same way as the original poster was.

(Note: This stuff really happens....)

Finally, if RDDT is negligent in preventing moderators from actively promoting false narratives (whether in a specific instance or not taking due care to prevent this occurrence, for instance via more robust site wide policies) RDDT also assumes liability.

Does this affect the longterm outlook for investors in RDDT?",0,,2025-03-15,-0.2263,0.9624,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.070875,0.0,0.0354375,51.771875,neutral

The stock sold off hard, but the fundamentals haven’t changed nearly as much as the price suggests. Analysts still have a median price target of ~$120, implying significant upside from here. I’m planning on buying LEAPS to take advantage of what looks like an overreaction.

Pros:

✅ Strong revenue growth – Still growing 23% YoY, despite ad spending softness
✅ High margins – 84% gross margins, which is best-in-class for ad tech
✅ Solid balance sheet – $1.5B in cash and no debt, giving them flexibility
✅ CTV dominance – Continued leadership in connected TV (CTV) advertising

Cons:

❌ Near-term ad spend weakness – Advertisers are cutting budgets in a tough macro environment
❌ Competitive pressures – Google and Amazon are pushing harder into programmatic advertising
❌ High valuation (even after the drop) – Still trades at 15-16x forward sales, though historically it’s commanded a premium

The long-term growth story for TTD remains intact, even if Q1 guidance disappointed. The market has punished it heavily, but historically, high-quality growth stocks tend to bounce back once macro pressures ease.

This has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday Ezra Klein's new episode dropped with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times reporter, and it is ALL about the Mar-A-Lago Accord.

You are not crazy - they tried to impose tariffs on our allies, the allies balked, and now the crew is salty and disorganized. They don't know what to do. Hilariously, Miran predicted this himself (this is in the summary, p.37, read it):

>These policies may supercharge efforts of those looking to minimize exposure to the United States. Efforts to find alternatives to the dollar and dollar assets will intensify. There remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “BRICS currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit.

Look at the peak Redditor sentiment— so much bearishness!! Inverse it and you will do very well.

You will read so many reddit comments that reflect their anger and disbelief that the market is suddenly ignoring tariff tweets— the market has now priced much of it in and market will believe that the uncertainty is largely over before April 2.

Remember COVID, the bottom was in around March 20. And redditors could not believe it even past April!!

So many redditors think the bottom will not occur until AFTER april 2 and they are wrong. Market is forward looking and will have discounted tariffs before then.

Look at this headline that dropped yesterday afternoon: New Canada PM Carney Says There’s Progress in US Trade Talks https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/carney-sworn-in-as-canada-leader-with-trade-dominating-agenda?embedded-checkout=true

Many redditors will FOMO back in next month or in May/June—they will lock in their previous losses —-just in time for the market to tank even harder! probably in Q3 when a real recession is here, and they panic again.

Just keep in mind the contrarian bearish AAII readings for 3 weeks in a row (it was as bad as 2009 GFC, it signaled a bottom in 2009) and SP500 Rsi at 30 and positive seasonality kicking in next week and positive vanna/charm March opex - all culminate into a rally of disbelief coming to destroy redditors’ sanity. 

Some data below:

INVESTOR SENTIMENT
AAII Bull/Bear Sentiment survey shows bearish sentiment at 60%, the highest level since recording 70% during 2008 financial crisis - reading this extreme show that 12 month later gains of 13.6%. This is the first time that bullish sentiment has been below 20% for three straight weeks. Bullish sentiment was last lower on September 22, 2022 (17.7%). 

Yesterday’s rally was a 90% upside breadth day. The last 90% day was 8/8/2024 - three days after the 8/5/2024 correction low.

VIX plunged 11% to 21 yesterday.

This was the 5th fastest correction in history. ALL previous rapid corrections found $SPX higher 3, 6, and 12 months forward. 

POSITIVE SEASONALITY INCOMING
$SPX seasonality roadmap would suggest we just bottomed into March OPEX, typically we see seasonal strength from late March and early April with a stronger June/July

stocks,The situation around European Defense Stocks,1jbrhrp,MisterTrader13,2025-03-15 05:36:31,2,0.52,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jbrhrp/the_situation_around_european_defense_stocks/,"I’m currently invested in American Defense Stocks (mostly Palantir) and a bunch of different European Defense Stocks. I got in a little late and only invested a few days ago.

I do believe the rally is not over yet. So far, I agree that it’s been pure speculation and Europe still has to pay up. However, I think we’re seeing a major cultural shift in Europe around defense. Trump said that if the EU doesn’t pay up, the US will completely remove all military funding to them. This obviously means Europe will have to pay to a certain extent. The question is, how much are they willing to pay up?

Let’s look at the situation right now. Ukraine is not done fighting yet and even if the US tries to help them get a ceasefire, so far the ceasefires conditions have not been accepted by Ukraine. Russia knows that the US under Trump will try to help negotiate more favourable conditions for them, which Ukraine will never agree to. So right now I don’t think the war is over yet. So that’ll definitely be more immediate spending by Europe on defense companies.

Even if we do somehow get a ceasefire within the next couple of weeks, the global environment has changed significantly. America does not want to send as much money overseas as it used to, and is moving more towards its original isolationist policies that were around before WW2. As china continues to scale up its military, it will continue to empower Russia to use as a buffer against the United States, and also get more favourable trades from them (oil, minerals etc.)

So without America, Europe will have to rely on itself. I don’t know how much Europe will be willing to spend on its military, but they are smart enough to know that the past 2 world wars happened on European soil and if they do not want a repeat of that, they can’t rely on anybody but themselves. No UN charter or rules or international law can save them when a countries more militarily armed than them decide to ignore the rules. 


So right now I’m just wondering how much do you guys think the EU will be willing to spend, at least over the next 4 years. How much of their budget do you think will be increased towards military spending. I know they’ve already increased it, but how much further are they willing to spend. 


Most people say Europe won’t spend much because of its culture around war. But keep in mind that that culture has only developed in the last 70 years. Before that Europe was a bloody place that had been fighting with each other for centuries. They know that if another war happens, even if it involves new powers from Asia, the European continent will not be spared. Another war or even the thought of it may actually break Europe. They spent the better part of the last century changing their culture around racial integration and rebuilding their economy from the rubbles. That culture was made for the sole purpose to avoid another war from ever happening. We like to think of the UN, WTO, WHO and all these international councils as to bring the world together, but their original purpose was to have better mutual cooperation and understanding in the west to prevent another war. 

Europe did everything except improve their military. I’d assume that was to prevent empowering threats from within Europe. Now that threats are coming out of Europe, they may have to start re-thinking their global outlook and strategy.

So these European Defense stock rallies could be the beginning of massive gains in the coming months and years.

Yields on German bonds surged as government leaders agreed on a massive defense spending package, while the ultimate haven asset — gold — topped $3,000 for the first time.

>The almost 2% advance in the S&P 500 was set to be the biggest since the aftermath of the presidential election. Not even data showing a slide in consumer confidence prevented the market rebound. That follows a selloff that culminated in a 10% plunge of the US equity benchmark from its peak. Treasuries trimmed a recent rally fueled by a flight to safety. Bullion climbed as much as 0.5% to $3,004.94 an ounce before erasing gains.

>The moves capped a week of drama that included Trump’s on-and-off-again tariffs, recession calls, geopolitical talks and concerns over a US government shutdown. Combined with all the questioning around lofty tech valuations, global equity funds saw their biggest redemption this year.

>“The markets are grappling with the notion of where fair value rests for a stock market that faces headwinds from tariffs, fiscal spending cuts, and potentially softening economic data, said Yung-Yu Ma at BMO Wealth Management. “Negative investor sentiment is building, so a multi-day relief rally could be coming soon.”

>Despite Friday’s advance, the S&P 500 still headed toward a fourth straight week of losses — the longest such streak since August. Trading volume was 10% below the average of the past month.

>“We are seeing some oversold rally efforts once again,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “But we caution folks looking to dive back in at the first sign of stability here: nearly everyone is looking for a bottom and to ‘buy the dip’ at some point, but the current condition of the markets has not implied any real improvement on a technical basis - the tape is simply very oversold at this stage.”

>Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities says he gets asked multiple times a day: “Is the worst over?”

>“We don’t know. We would like to see a capitulation trade, but the seasonals are starting to turn,” Brenner said. “The end of February to the middle of March is an awful time for equity seasonals.”

>It took just 16 trading sessions for US stocks to tumble into a correction, leaving a frazzled Wall Street asking just how long the “adjustment period” White House officials have warned about will last.

>In the prior 24 instances when stocks have fallen at least 10% from a record but avoided a bear market, it has taken an average of eight months to reclaim an all-time high, according to data from CFRA Research. That would leave the Feb. 19 high intact until mid-October. The average drawdown reached 14% in those cases.

>“Corrections are unnerving in the moment, though they are not unusual, and often act as a pressure release valve for overheated markets,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This will not be the last correction, pullback, or market scare that the bulls will have to face, and yes, an element of caution is warranted.”

>“We say this is a correction, not a bear market in US stocks,” Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett said. “Since equity bear threatens recession, fresh declines in stock prices will provoke flip in trade and monetary policy.”

>Yet a century-old indicator that has helped predict the direction of the US stock market is signaling more pain ahead for battered investors.

>Known as the Dow Theory, it holds that moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average must be confirmed by transport stocks, and vice versa, to be sustained. As of Thursday’s close, the 20-member Dow Jones Transportation Average — a barometer of consumer and industrial demand — has slumped 19% from its November peak, teetering near so-called bear-market territory.

>“What usually differentiates quicker (often healthy) selloffs from drawn-out bear markets is whether a recession follows,” said Ross Mayfield at Baird Private Wealth Management.

>The 23 non-recession corrections since 1965 averaged a 16% drawdown, he said. Meantime, the 8 recession selloffs over that period averaged a 36% drawdown.

Apple Inc.’s top executive overseeing its Siri virtual assistant told staff that delays to key features have been ugly and embarrassing, and a decision to publicly promote the technology before it was ready made matters worse.

Robby Walker, who serves as a senior director at Apple, delivered the stark comments during an all-hands meeting for the Siri division, saying that the team was facing a bad period. Walker also said that it’s unclear when the enhancements will actually launch, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the gathering was private.

The frank discussion shows the extent of Apple’s crisis in the field of artificial intelligence, where it’s struggling to catch up with peers. Siri — less advanced than rival systems — has become a symbol of Apple’s AI challenges. And the company’s woes boiled over last week, when it acknowledged publicly that critical features would be delayed indefinitely. 

During the all-hands gathering, Walker suggested that employees on his team may be feeling angry, disappointed, burned out and embarrassed after the features were postponed. The company had been racing to get the technology ready for this spring, but now the features aren’t expected until next year at the earliest, people familiar with the matter have said. 

Still, he praised the team for developing “incredibly impressive” features and vowed to deliver an industry-leading virtual assistant to consumers. 

On Feb. 14, Bloomberg News reported that Apple was struggling with bugs and engineering problems on its planned artificial intelligence tools for Siri. At the time, the company postponed the release from April to May, aiming to include the features in its iOS 18.5 operating system. Now it’s looking to add them as an update as early as the iOS 19 software cycle next year.

The features — unveiled last June at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference — are fundamental to making Siri a more effective personal assistant. The technology will allow the software to tap into users’ personal data to better respond to queries. It also will let Siri more precisely control apps and analyze content that’s on a user’s screen.

But when Apple demonstrated the features at WWDC using a video mock-up, it only had a barely working prototype, Bloomberg has reported. Walker told staff in the meeting that the delays were especially “ugly” because Apple had already showed off the features publicly. “This was not one of these situations where we get to show people our plan after it’s done,” he said. “We showed people before.”

“To make matters worse,” Walker said, Apple’s marketing communications department wanted to promote the enhancements. Despite not being ready, the capabilities were included in a series of marketing campaigns and TV commercials starting last year.

Apple touted the features as a key selling point of the iPhone 16 line, which otherwise lacked major changes. And it’s part of a broader AI push called Apple Intelligence.

Walker also raised doubts about even meeting the current release expectations. Though Apple is aiming for iOS 19, it “doesn’t mean that we’re shipping then,” Walker said. The company has several more priorities in development, and trade-offs will need to be made, he said.

“We have other commitments across Apple to other projects,” Walker said, citing new software and hardware initiatives. “We want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred.” He said decisions on timing will be made on a “case-by-case basis” as work progresses on products planned for next year.

“Customers are not expecting only these new features but they also want a more fully rounded-out Siri,” he said. “We’re going to ship these features and more as soon as they are ready.”

Walker said that there is “intense personal accountability” about this effort shared by his boss John Giannandrea, the head of AI at Apple, as well as software chief Craig Federighi and other executives.

As of Friday, Apple doesn’t plan to immediately fire any top executives over the AI crisis, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That decision could theoretically change at any time. In any case, the company is poised to make management adjustments. It has discussed moving more senior executives under Giannandrea to assist with a turnaround effort. Already, the company tapped longtime executive Kim Vorrath — seen as a project fixer — to assist the group.

Walker said the decision to delay the features was made because of quality issues and that the company has found the technology only works properly up to two-thirds to 80% of the time. He said the group “can make more progress to get those percentages up, so that users get something they can really count on.”

In recent weeks, Federighi voiced concerns to other senior executives that the features weren’t working as advertised, ultimately prompting the decision to delay, Bloomberg reported. Issues with Apple Intelligence were clear from the start, with the company postponing the first batch of features last year and providing vague timelines during its launch event.

Walker defended his Siri group, telling them that they should be proud. Employees poured their “hearts and souls into this thing,” he said. “I saw so many people giving everything they had in order to make this happen and to make incredible progress together.”

But Apple wants to maintain a high bar and only deliver the features when they’re polished, he said. “These are not quite ready to go to the general public, even though our competitors might have launched them in this state or worse.”

He showed examples during the meeting of the technology working: It was able to locate his driver’s license number on command and find specific photos of a child. He also demonstrated how the technology could precisely manipulate apps via voice control. It embedded content in an email, added recipients and made other changes.

Walker told staff that they should “feel really proud of innovative work” done to develop the personal search feature, despite saying it doesn’t always work sufficiently.

Still, the company has met other goals for Siri. That includes bringing a Type-to-Siri interface to iOS 18, as well as adding Apple product knowledge to the platform and an improved understanding of customers. It’s planning to offer Apple Intelligence in several new languages next month and is working overtime to enable the features for China as part of partnerships with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc.

The executive said he didn’t want things to get worse before they got better, saying that special attention will need to be paid to the integration of existing features into iOS 19.

But there’s still a long road ahead. The delayed Siri features are just the first step toward modernizing the software. Apple has been planning upgrades for 2027 that will make Siri more conversational, letting it better compete with other AI chatbots, Bloomberg has reported.",0,,2025-03-14,-0.5106,0.9668,-0.7986778616905212,-0.9028335213661194,0.75,0.25,-0.14125000000000001,-0.8247167766094208,-0.4829833883047104,25.850830584764484,negative

stocks,"EU’s big Starlink headache is time, not money",1jb8fno,Grigori_Rasputin1869,2025-03-14 12:47:53,54,0.86,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jb8fno/eus_big_starlink_headache_is_time_not_money/,"LONDON, March 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - As relations between Ukraine and the Trump administration sour, Kyiv has encountered a pressing problem: it relies on Starlink to help its military coordinate operations. The good news is that it wouldn’t break the bank to replace Elon Musk’s satellite operator with kit supplied by $3 billion Anglo-French rival Eutelsat (ETL.PA), opens new tab. The bad news is that executing such a switch would be highly complex – and couldn’t happen overnight.

As things stand it doesn’t look like Musk will imminently axe Ukraine’s Starlink access, which is part funded by Poland. He just wants the world to know there would be devastating consequences if he did. In a March 9 post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the billionaire claimed Ukraine’s “entire front line would collapse” without links to his satellites. Though he went on to insist he’d never pull the plug, such episodes underline the case for using a satellite operator based in the European Union.

At first glance, the costs of such a swap might appear to be a major barrier. Providing internet from space requires terminals on the ground to transmit satellite signals to end users, and analysts estimate the price of one Eutelsat ground terminal is around $10,000. Musk’s company, by comparison, offers terminals to Ukrainian consumers at less than $600 each. Assuming each of Starlink’s 40,000 or so terminals in Ukraine is eventually swapped out with a Eutelsat one, the replacement drive would cost $400 million before the internet is even switched on.

Weighed against the EU’s $17 trillion GDP this expense looks bearable, though. The European Commission is talking about mobilising 800 billion euros for defence, including 150 billion euros in loans for member states to spend on weapons. Throw in scope to raise pandemic-style joint debt at the EU level, and the bloc should be both able and willing to fund a satcom switch for Ukraine.

What’s less clear is whether Eutelsat’s OneWeb constellation has the satellite heft to deliver a quality of internet comparable to Musk’s outfit. Eutelsat has around 650 satellites in low earth orbit, far less than Starlink’s 7,000-strong fleet. Calculations by investment bank Bryan Garnier suggest the OneWeb constellation could only offer Ukraine one or two dozen gigabits of data per second (GBPS), a rate sufficient to supply around 10,000 residential ground terminals. Eutelsat has a powerful satellite in farther-flung geostationary orbit that could help to fill the gap, but whether the result is connectivity on par with Starlink’s is uncertain.

Capacity concerns aside, there are also questions around Eutelsat’s ability to roll out the new terminals on the ground at the necessary pace. The company’s CEO Eva Berneke told Bloomberg, opens new tab that the group would be capable of sourcing 40,000 of them in a matter of months. But unlike Starlink, which makes all its own equipment, Eutelsat relies on third parties to supply its terminals. These vary in terms of size and capabilities, with several bulky and power-hungry designs in the mix.

Even if Eutelsat can get its hands on the kit in a matter of months, there’s no guarantee that the mix of those terminals would meet the actual demands of Ukraine’s forces on the ground, according to Hamish Low of Enders Analysis. Matching terminals to the appropriate locations and users will take time.

One consolation is that Ukraine doesn’t necessarily need all of its Starlink capacity to fight a war with Russia. Some of the terminals in the country are used by civilians for day-to-day communications, while others support government institutions.

Another consolation is that Eutelsat may have some breathing space. The U.S. agreed on March 12 to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Compared with last month, when Trump administration negotiators reportedly raised the possibility of cutting off Starlink if a critical minerals deal failed to materialise, that arguably counts as a conciliatory turn.
At 6 euros, Eutelsat shares have risen fivefold in the two weeks since Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s infamous White House encounter with Trump. That’s still far below the 30 euros-plus at which they traded a decade ago, and the company still has around 2.5 billion euros of net debt. Either way investors seem confident that Eutelsat will be a winner in Europe’s rearmament – the question is how committed EU politicians are to ramping it up.

> Tesla's brand has become increasingly politicized, with some people viewing the company as an endorsement of Elon Musk's politics. This has led to a backlash against the company, with some owners expressing buyer's remorse and others vandalizing Tesla vehicles and property. Despite this, Tesla's popularity has increased among Republicans and conservatives, with some surveys showing a significant rise in favorable opinions of the company among this group. However, analysts note that this shift may not necessarily translate to increased sales, as the demographic most interested in electric vehicles - liberals and progressives - is being driven away from the brand.

Gold prices have surged to a record high, surpassing $3,000 per ounce for the first time, driven by trade tensions/uncertainty. This is somewhat similar to my VXX/VIX play from a few days ago, essentially a short volatility trade. Again, still short VXX because I think we've peaked (for now) in terms of volatility. VXX makes bigger moves in vol trades compared to gold so I prefer it for vol shorts.  The rise in gold prices shows how it still remains the hedge over the Coin, which essentially trades in-line with the market because it's still speculative. Overall trade tensions die down, Trump announces tariffs are over, the typical tariff business.

We will likely continue to see huge downturns in the US stock market continue for the next 6 months, as these tariffs aren’t even fixed.

As such, I have started looking outside the US stock market for better opportunities. There will never be opportunities as good as the US stock market, as it has the largest trading volume and is also the most valuable stock market. But as the world becomes more industrialised, it’s a global market and there’s increasingly more opportunities everywhere.

I’m currently ruling out Europe and the rest of North America for now. The tariffs are directed to these nations and it doesn’t look like it’s going stop anytime soon. China used to be a good alternative but I think we’re gonna see a lot of tariffs towards it by Trump soon, I wouldn’t invest in it. Plus, it’s pretty restrictive on who can invest and how much.

Most western nations are somehow the prime target of Trump, so Australia and New Zealand will likely be affected soon too. Plus, their economies are pretty small, with only a few niche exports (mostly natural resources). I just know Japan and South Korea are next, Trump won’t spare them and has talked many times about tariffing them hard.

I’ve been looking at South East Asia, the Middle East, South America and Africa. I know these are emerging economies but I’m grasping at thin air here. The US economy looks like it’s gonna be going down a while and it’s gonna bring every other major economy with it. It truly looks like the unravelling of free trade agreements happening in real time.

March 21, 2025, is a significant date in financial markets, as it is the third Friday of March. Traditionally, options and futures contracts usually have their expiration dates on the third Friday of each month. Therefore, on this date, numerous options and futures contracts on various assets will expire, which could lead to an increase in volatility and trading volume in the financial markets.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Rival earbuds such as Google's Pixel Buds have had the option for years, the report said.
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company had last year said its AirPods Pro 2 can be turned into a personalized hearing aid via software updates.

The CME fedwatch survey shows market expects Fed to do 2-3 rate cuts this year.

But in my view, with the present uncertainty with fast changing tariff rules and DOGE based cuts, the Fed cannot model it's affect on the inflation and unemployment.  
Without a working model and predictions, ***Fed cannot realistically cut rates***.

The best they can do is hold rates and wait for some clarity on how much tariffs will be applied into this year and next. And then decide on whether to cut or raise rates. The affect of tariff will take time to show up in the economy and there is still time for Fed to act.

And if Fed acts early and say makes a rate cut , and 2 months later we end-up with high inflation, it will make things a lot worse and raising rates will panic the market.

Additionally the deportation hasn't picked up and it will also affect the economy in unknown ways. Deportation can cut unemployment and raise inflation, which would force Fed to maintain rates or in worse case raise them.

The Fed rate cut expectations from traders/investors, is more out of desperation hoping that cut will boost the market. It will be very dangerous to act early and Fed having seen the inflation past 2 years will be cautious.

I expect Powell to not commit to any rate cut, instead sweet talk saying we are watching closely and in case of any risk of recession, high unemployment or liquidity crisis, we will act aggressively. But right now we are waiting to see how the tariff affects unfolds and we will follow the data.  
In short talk encouraging but not commit to any rate cut.

Am interested in your views ( to make sure I am not thinking wrong or crazy.)

**Top Lessons:**
- Value investing centers on acquiring ownership in businesses by assessing their true worth, rather than trading stocks based on market momentum.
- The research-driven process requires investors to methodically analyze financial data and business operations, setting aside emotional biases or snap judgments to determine a company's long-term potential.
- Value investors emphasize a company's core fundamentals— such as consistent cash flows, tangible assets, and reliable earnings-over transient market price swings. By anchoring their focus on these measurable attributes, they avoid being swayed by speculative trends or short-lived volatility in stock valuations.
- The practice of value investing involves calculating a company's intrinsic economic value, derived from its financial statements and operational performance, which remains steadier than its market price. This disciplined valuation approach allows investors to pinpoint opportunities where the stock price diverges significantly from the business's underlying worth.
- Patience and discipline are essential in value investing, as stocks bought at a discount to their intrinsic value often need months or years to reach their fair market price. Investors must commit to holding these positions, trusting that over time, the market will adjust to reflect the company's fundamental strengths.
- Value investors target stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios, typically indicating that a company's market price undervalues its earnings capacity relative to peers. Rather than chasing popular or overhyped stocks, they seek out these underappreciated opportunities, which statistical evidence suggests offer a greater margin of safety and return potential.
- Evaluating a company's competitive advantages—such as cost efficiencies from scale, strong customer loyalty, or patented technologies—is a key step in identifying businesses with durable profitability. These advantages, quantifiable through market share data or profit margins, signal a company's ability to maintain its economic edge and deliver sustained value to shareholders.

The US stock market can flip into a correction territory as retail and institutional buyers are running out of steam, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Scott Rubner, the bank’s managing director for global markets and tactical specialist.

“The flow dynamics change dramatically starting Monday and I am on correction watch,” Rubner wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

US stocks hit a new record high on Wednesday despite uncertainty around tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path. Strong gains have been driven by resilient corporate earnings and strong flows from retail and institutional investors. But these dynamics could change starting from Monday, Rubner wrote.

Demand from retail traders, which have been piling into US stocks at a record pace this year, is expected to slow down ahead of the tax paying season in March. Flows from pension funds can also “run out of juice,” according to Rubner attributing it to seasonal trends. January and February are typically the strongest months of the year for yearly asset allocations, followed by weaker inflows in March.

Positioning across trend-following systematic funds also looks bearish. Commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, which buy or sell stocks depending on the market direction, are estimated to sell about $61 billion in US stocks over the next month should markets go lower, compared to only about $10 billion of buying in a bullish scenario.

On top of that, options market positioning also points to some volatility. According to Goldman’s estimates, dealers are currently long $9.8 billion of S&P 500 gamma, which acts as a market buffer when dealers are buying the dip. However, the bank’s index trading team estimates that 50% of this long gamma position rolls off Friday, and the market will have the ability to move more freely next week.

stocks,Stocks Tumble Into Correction as Investors Sour on Trump,1jalltg,Shalaiyn,2025-03-13 16:17:22,2211,0.93,416,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jalltg/stocks_tumble_into_correction_as_investors_sour/,"he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

""A faster timeline appears likely given geopolitical events in recent weeks, in our view. Reaching 3% of GDP by 2030 would offer a 12% CAGR in defence spending.""

Germany and the UK are set to significantly increase their defence budgets over the coming years, benefiting companies such as Rheinmetall ($RHM), the research firm's top pick; Renk Group ($R3NK); QinetiQ Group ($QQ); and Babcock International Group ($BAB).

As such, the research firm upgraded its rating on Babcock to buy from hold and raised the price target to 8.85 pounds sterling from 5.75 pounds, while boosting Rheinmetall's price target to 1,410 euros from 750 euros and maintaining its buy rating.

Price: ~$184

My Postions:
5x 1/16/26 $185 puts
5x 1/16/26 $170 puts

Bear Case: 

With the current economic instability and uncertainty, many stocks from all industries have seen sharp decreases in value. For the case of this write up, I will mostly be focused on hotel, restaurant, and airline industries, since these industries are closely correlated and are considered elastic goods. Moreover, tourism to the United States, which is a key revenue source for these industries, will likely be down going forward due to rises in foreign tensions. Many Canadians are already talking about cancelling and boycotting travel to the United States, so these industries will feel the repercussions in the following months/years.

Airlines: 
Delta: -30% in the past month
United Airlines: -28% in the past month
American Airlines: -30% in the past month

Restaurants/Food:
Sbux: -12.7% in the past month
Cava: -37% in the past month
Wingstop: -30% in the past month
Chipotle: -14% in the past month

Hotels:
Hyatt: -15.33% in the past month
Mariott: -15.4% in the past month
Hilton: -15.26% in the past month

$DRI has not yet taken a hit from the recent economic turmoil, only dropping 5% in the past month. Due to the target audience of its restaurants, I believe that they are more susceptible to the affects of a recession than fast food restaurants such as Wingstop, Chipotle, and Cava, which have seen significant dips recently. 

Restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse are treated as a night out for lower class/lower middle class Americans, and will be among the first expenses to be cut when budgets inevitably tighten. I believe in the case of a recession, more Americans will ditch restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse than Chipotle, Wingstop, and Cava.

For reference here is how $DRI performed during the past recessions/pullbacks

2008: -68.5% decrease
2020: -63% decrease
2022: -25% decrease

I believe $DRI has much room to fall over the next year and maybe even longer.

I have a wash sale tax question. Please help if you can.

I bought some SPY shares on 09/2024 and again on 12/2024, 1/2025, 2/2025, and 3/2025. All the shares bought since 12/2024 are bought within 30 days of each other.

Obviously, all the shares that I bought since 12/2024 are now in the red. I have some capital gains by selling other shares and would like to tax harvest these SPY shares.

If I sell all the SPY shares that I bought since 12/2024 and realize a loss of around 20k, (I can buy VTI right away). Would this trigger a wash sale?

It seems like I am clear for the 30days look back (since I didn't buy any SPY between 09/2024 and 12/2024) and I am not buying SPY or anything similar 30 days from now, I should be in the clear. However because I made many purchases between 12/2024 and 03/2025 (but I sell all those shares), I am not sure how the tax law treats these purchases. For example, the loss from the 03/2025 lot would trigger the wash sale on the 02/2025 lot etc.

In Private Space Exploration, we often only hear about Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is just a way for him to burn money and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic is a complete and total failure (I think it was just a publicity stunt).

But, there exists one other end-to-end space company, and it is the only one currently making revenue and has actual customers (apart from SpaceX). Its Electon rocket is the most used small rocket in the world and is the second-most used orbital rocket in the world (SpaceX’s falcon 9 is the most used rocket in the world).

Rocket Lab is current working on Neutron, which is set to be a much bigger rocket and will cost less than SpaceX’s Falcon 9. It will also have a higher payload capacity than Falcon 9.

I got interested in this company after hearing these fundamentals. It’s not easy to make a rocket company, and it’s even more difficult to actually get clients for it and make the company successful. Electron to date has delivered more than 200 satellites to orbit.

Then I decided to find out more about the founder of this company. Unlike Elon Musk, who isn’t a rocket engineer and had $200 million from the sale of PayPal to burn with SpaceX, the CEO of Peter Beck is from New Zealand and a college dropout. He worked as in various engineering companies at low positions and learnt how to make rocket fuel on his own. With his hands-on experience and accomplishments, he tried to come to America and work for NASA, but was laughed out off the office because he didn’t have a college degree, and was a foreigner.

He went back to New Zealand and with very little capital from 1 investor, Mark Rocket, he started Rocket Lab. During its early days, he described himself vommiting in the toilet before every launch as 1 failure could break the entire company. To date, the company has launched the Electron Rocket to orbit 60 times successfully.

When asked how he’s built rocket lab into such a consistently successful launch services provider, his response was that they “just kept their head down and worked hard” and will continue to do so, regardless of whether they got the fame most space companies get in the media. This is a much better attitude than Elon’s.

I think Rocket Lab has potential to become a $100 billion company!

stocks,Could Europe's Eutelsat help to replace Starlink in Ukraine?,1ja6mud,Mdiasrodrigu,2025-03-13 03:35:46,69,0.88,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ja6mud/could_europes_eutelsat_help_to_replace_starlink/,"HOW DOES EUTELSAT COMPARE TO STARLINK?

Eutelsat already supports government and institutional communications in Ukraine, and told Reuters that it can provide an alternative for certain government and defence applications.

Since its merger in 2023 with Britain's OneWeb, Eutelsat controls the only operational global-coverage constellation, besides Starlink, of satellites in low earth orbit (LEO).

Starlink's more than 7,000 LEO satellites, suited to real-time communication, allow it to reach more users around the world and offer higher data speeds.

But Eutelsat says that, even with only 630 or so LEO satellites, backed up by 35 linked satellites in higher, geostationary orbit, it offers the same capabilities as Starlink in Europe.

Starlink promises broadband at up to 200 megabits per second, Eutelsat 150.

OneWeb terminals, however, cost as much as $10,000, plus a monthly subscription price. Starlink charges Ukrainian users a one-time payment of $589 in addition to a monthly subscription of $95-$440, depending on the usage.

It is not known whether any donor would offer to fund more Ukrainian OneWeb subscriptions. France and Britain, which are spearheading a peace deal to present to the U.S., hold a combined 24.8% stake in Eutelsat Group.

On bad news → Stocks drop but not much (investors see dips as buying opportunities).

On no news → Stocks tend to grind higher with small but steady gains (bullish sentiment sustains upward momentum).

On paper, I get that it could boost revenue, but I don’t see how $LUV can compete now that they’re essentially just another airline. Their stock is already trading at a 40 P/E ratio—the highest in the airline industry—and I’m struggling to justify that valuation.

For context, I fly about 35 times a year for work and took 20+ Southwest flights last year. In many cases, their fares are as expensive—if not more expensive—than Delta or American, yet both of those airlines offer a significantly better experience. Southwest also has inconvenient flight times for business travelers, with many departures in the mid-morning, early afternoon, or late at night (8 PM or later).

Beyond that, they don’t offer lounge access—small detail, but another premium feature their competitors have that they don’t. And of course, we all remember the massive tech failures that caused travel disruptions last year. I just don’t see how they make the jump to a premium airline identity like United, American, or Delta - which is who they will be competing with. More likely, they evolve into something of a hybrid between Spirit and their former self—a budget airline with easy to understand rules (no assigned seats), a fun brand (wanna get away), a few perks and clear and transparent fares but nothing truly differentiating anymore.

Given all this, I’m seriously considering shorting $LUV, and targeting a future $12-18 per share price within the next 12 months. Curious to hear what others think.

Expect impact on airlines, hotels, retail, restaurants",1j9zdif,Mountain-Taro-123,2025-03-12 20:28:31,6501,0.96,852,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9zdif/trump_new_travel_barriers_for_canadian_tourists/,"Today the Trump administration announced new visitation barriers for Canadian tourists. Any tourists staying longer than 30 days must register and provide fingerprints to authorities. How many Canadians actually vacation longer for 30 days+ in the US you may ask?

* **1 million snowbirds (Canadian tourists** travelling to the US to avoid Canadian winters) reportedly **contributed $6.5b** to Florida's economy **during just a 6 month period** (typical duration of their stays)
* **Canadians were the largest visitors to the US** comprising of **\~30% of all US tourist visits** in 2023.
* Those tourists with billions in combined disposable income just had it harder to come to the US to spend their money
* While this policy in isolation may not have a material impact, combined with instigating a trade war and threats of annexation seemed to have turned off many Canadians (rightfully so) on spending a single penny in the US.
* Since Canada was the only country previously exempted from this rule, reversing this is policy is leaving many Canadians feeling further alienated by the US, especially given their economic contributions to local US economies

I'm bearish for Q2, Q3, and potentially Q4 for the following industries

* **REITs**: NNN REIT, Drop in tourism will bankrupt many small US businesses with thin margins in the restaurant industry. While you can't make investment moves on small businesses, this will lead to defaulting on their leases and commercial REITs that focus on restaurants will have high vacancy rates.
* **Travel Bookers**: Expedia? Not sure how much of their revenue concentration is based on US bookings vs. global
* **Hotels:** Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Air Bnb, Caesars Entertainment
* **Airlines:** American, Delta, United, Air Canada,
* **QSRs:** Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, Brinker International (food chains primarily with US locations attract tourists due to the novelty factor of not being able to go in Canada)
* **Amusement Parks**: Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, United Parks & Resorts
* **Car Rentals:** Enterprise, Hertz, Avis
* **Retail**: TJX Companies, Ross, Macys, Kohls, Target (retail stores with no presence in Canada are often attract tourists who are interested in shopping at retail stores they can't back in Canada)
* **Energy**: Shell, Chevron, Exxon (lots of Canadian tourists do road trips and gas up in the US, but since these companies also operate in Canada and Canadians are just going to replace their US road triups with Canadian ones, I do not believe they will be impacted

Other factors to consider before making moves

* Can US consumer spending or tourists from other countries fill the economic void Canadian tourists will leave in the tune of billions of dollars?
* Will other countries follow suite, either as a response to the US administrations polices, or in a sign of solidary with Canadians?
* Even if positive relations are restored between US-Canada by the end of the year, will that change souring Canadian consumer sentiment to US businesses and travel?

Edit: In no way is this post a dig at Canadians for deciding to stop visiting. I am also Canadian. This post is a purely from a finance/stock perspective on which industries will get negatively impacted by this administrations policies the most so that people here can adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly if they have exposure into said industries. Vive la Canada!

stocks,Trump’s FTC Moves Ahead With Broad Microsoft Antitrust Probe,1j9ywql,WinningWatchlist,2025-03-12 20:06:31,186,0.94,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9ywql/trumps_ftc_moves_ahead_with_broad_microsoft/,">The US Federal Trade Commission is moving ahead with a sprawling antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp. that was opened in the waning days of the Biden Administration, signaling that Donald Trump’s new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

>The FTC sent Microsoft a so-called civil investigative demand, which is similar to a subpoena, late last year. The document, a copy of which was viewed by Bloomberg, compels the company to turn over reams of data about its AI operations, including the cost to train models and obtain data, going as far back as 2016. The agency sought details about Microsoft’s data centers, its struggles to find enough computing power to meet customer demand and the company’s software licensing practices.

>The FTC is also scrutinizing Microsoft’s decision to slash funding on its own artificial intelligence projects after striking a deal with OpenAI, which could be perceived as hurting competition in the burgeoning AI market.

>One company has heard regularly from the FTC on the issue of Microsoft’s licensing practices since the investigative demand was sent, said one of the people. The FTC and lawyers for that company have discussed what information the agency could ask for in a more comprehensive, formal request. The company also received a shorter list of questions several weeks ago asking for documents the company provided to other regulators. The FTC is further seeking information about licensing rule changes Microsoft said will go into effect later this year, the person said.

>The agency said in the information demand that it wants to determine whether Microsoft’s profits from other parts of the business give it an edge over other AI companies. The agency also said it wants details about Microsoft’s data center capacity constraints to better understand the costs behind cloud-computing services. Those details will help the agency determine whether to bring a case.

>Since receiving the FTC demand, Microsoft may have sought to narrow the scope of the information it’s being asked to turn over — a typical move by companies being probed by the agency. Such wide-ranging antitrust investigations can take years and don’t always result in the agency bringing a case.

>“We are working cooperatively with the agency,” said Alex Haurek, a Microsoft spokesman. The FTC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

>The evolution of the probe now rests in the hands of Ferguson and his new head of competition, Daniel Guarnera, who joined the agency from the Justice Department, where he worked on antitrust cases targeting Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc.

>In his first public remarks since taking the chair position in late February, Ferguson said investigating the tech sector is his highest priority. Early moves include seeking information on censorship by tech companies.

>Ferguson also backed a filing in January in support of billionaire Elon Musk, who sued to derail OpenAI’s plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business.

>The civil investigative demand was crafted by FTC staff and personally signed off on by former Chair Lina Khan after the agency spent more than a year conducting informal interviews with Microsoft competitors and business partners, Bloomberg previously reported.

>Ferguson’s FTC has inherited several other cases against big tech companies from Khan, including lawsuits against Meta Platforms Inc. and [Amazon](http://Amazon.com) Inc. On Wednesday, the agency asked a judge to delay a trial challenging Amazon’s Prime subscription practices, citing resource constraints at the agency. The FTC quickly walked back comments that resource constraints at the agency will hamper its ability to start a trial in September.

>Most of the questions in the information demand relate to how Microsoft licenses its software products, particularly as it relates to the company’s cloud-computing business. Competitors have complained that Microsoft’s licensing terms and bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings makes it harder for them to compete.

>About a third of the questions focus on Microsoft’s AI business, highlighting the importance of the burgeoning technology to the company’s future. Underlying the FTC’s requests are concerns that Microsoft canceled some of its own work after deciding to invest in deciding to invest in OpenAI and learning heavily on its GPT software, eliminating potential competition.

>Despite the hefty sum, Microsoft didn’t disclose its investment to competition regulators ahead of time, and the FTC also has been investigating whether the deal was structured as a partnership to avoid a merger investigation, Bloomberg has reported.

>When Microsoft first invested in OpenAI in 2019, the startup was a promising research lab looking for a way to fund the cloud-computing power required to create AI models. Microsoft started with a $1 billion infusion after co-founder Musk withdrew his backing. Microsoft had been working on various AI projects of its own for more than two decades and feared it was falling behind rival Google.

>The company’s efforts were scattered across several divisions and not producing the results Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had hoped for. In 2023, one month after pumping an additional $10 billion into OpenAI, Microsoft began unveiling a series of products infused with OpenAI technology. Microsoft pulled back on its internal effort to develop the technology, which raised a red flag for the FTC is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

Nearly 1,500 artists generated more than $1 million in royalties from Spotify in 2024, the company said Wednesday in its annual Loud and Clear Report.

Spotify said more than 80% of the artists in that pool did not have a song reach the app’s Global Daily Top 50 chart. To reach that million-dollar threshold, an artist would need to have around four to five million monthly listeners, or 20 million to 25 million monthly streams.

“Spotify has helped level the playing field for artists at every stage of their careers,” the company said in the report. “Success in the streaming era doesn’t require a decade-spanning catalog nor a chart-topping hit.”

The news comes about a month after the company reported a fourth-quarter earnings beat that saw the Swedish music streamer record its first full year of profitability.

Spotify said the upper echelon of royalties, artists who generate more than $10 million, has soared 600% since 2017, reaching a total of 70 for 2024.

The company said it paid an all-time high of $10 billion in royalties to the music industry for 2024, a figure it claimed is “more than any single retailer has ever paid in a year, and over 10x the contribution of the largest record store at the height of the CD era.”

Spotify does not pay per stream. Instead, it calculates a rights holder’s “streamshare,” or the percentage of streams they get out of a particular market.

Google said it tested the Gemini Robotics model on data from its bi-arm robotics platform, ALOHA 2, but can be specialized for complex use cases such as Apptronik's Apollo robot.

Google's launch comes a month after robotics startup Figure AI [exited](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/robotics-startup-figure-ai-talks-new-funding-395-billion-valuation-bloomberg-2025-02-14/) its collaboration agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI after it made an internal breakthrough in AI for robots.

What are Google investors thinking of this strategic decision?

There is a strong argument that the slower month-on-month CPI increase is due to weak consumer demand. Look at the breakdown of the categories.

Airline fares and gasoline prices dropped by 4.0% and 1.0% respectively. This suggests weaker consumer demand for travel.

New vehicle prices declined by 0.1%. This indicates consumers are holding back on large discretionary purchases. This also aligns with the consumer confidence index from a couple of weeks back which highlighted a drop in sentiment on large purchases in the near future by consumers

stocks,Tesla investor survey shows 85% believe Elon Musk’s politics are having ‘negative’ or ‘extremely negative’ impact on company,1j9mlkx,Puginator,2025-03-12 11:26:21,5606,0.97,185,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9mlkx/tesla_investor_survey_shows_85_believe_elon_musks/,"More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities are hurting his business.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Meta Platforms on Wednesday said they support efforts to at least triple nuclear energy worldwide by 2050.

The tech companies signed a pledge first adopted in December 2023 by more than 20 countries, including the U.S., at the U.N. Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.


The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.

Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won’t provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.

Amazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.

Meta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.

The pledge signed Wednesday was led by the World Nuclear Association on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.",0,,2025-03-12,0.5267,0.9758,0.0,0.7943735122680664,0.75,0.25,0.638975,0.1985933780670166,0.4187841890335083,70.93920945167541,positive

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

stocks,EU Targets €26 Billion of US Products in Tariff Retaliation,1j9iwgp,WinningWatchlist,2025-03-12 08:28:56,226,0.97,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9iwgp/eu_targets_26_billion_of_us_products_in_tariff/,">The European Union launched countermeasures on Wednesday against new US metals tariffs, with plans to impose its own duties on up to €26 billion ($28.3 billion) worth of American goods.

>The announcement came hours after the US administration imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a massive escalation of the trade war between the longstanding allies. The EU will target politically sensitive goods in Republican-led states, including soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, according to a senior EU official.

>EU metals tariffs that had been put in place during Trump’s first term, and later suspended, are due to be reintroduced in full on April 1, including some levies that have never previously been in force.

>The EU will also immediately begin consultations with member states, with the aim of adopting the additional lists of agricultural and industrial goods subject to tariffs as high as 25% by mid-April. Officials said the idea is to allow a window for negotiations, which will be led by the bloc’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic.

>“The countermeasures we take today are strong yet proportionate,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters at a briefing in Strasbourg. “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geo-economic and political uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with such tariffs.”

>While the EU announced immediately retaliatory steps, other affected countries, including the UK, refrained from immediate action and called for negotiations.

>European stocks rallied on Wednesday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 gaining 0.7% and Germany’s DAX rallying 1.2% as traders reacted to progress toward a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. The euro was little changed, pausing after a sharp rally in the past days.

>For Europe, the new levies will be nearly four times the size of similar duties imposed during Trump’s first term, when the US targeted €6.4 billion of the bloc’s metals exports, citing national security concerns. The value of those previous levies is now €4.5 billion based on current EU-US trade volumes, according to an EU official.

>The EU will target US steel and aluminum products, as well as textiles, agricultural products and home appliances.

>For now, the EU plan is to penalize €22.5 billion of goods in total, an official said, although the bloc has the right to raise that to match the full €26 billion value of the US tariffs. It aims to target products that will inflict damage in politically sensitive places in the US while avoiding additional economic pain for Europe.

>The EU is planning to hit beef and poultry from Republican-led states Nebraska and Kansas, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The bloc’s list will include products from its previous trade fight with Trump such as boats, bourbon and motorbikes.

>The EU can begin sourcing some targeted products from outside the US, such as soybeans from Brazil or Argentina, according to the official.

>In addition, Trump has announced reciprocal tariffs coming in early April based on policies of partners that are seen as obstacles to US trade, including Europe’s value-added tax, and has targeted certain goods including European cars.

>Sefcovic traveled to Washington last month to try to find an amicable solution with senior members of the Trump team including US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. He offered to lower tariffs on industrial goods, including cars, one of Trump’s longstanding demands, and increasing US imports of liquefied natural gas and defense goods.

>“The disruption caused by tariffs is avoidable if the US administration accepts our extended hand and works with us to strike a deal,” Sefcovic said Wednesday. “We are ready to negotiate.”

>In the European steel market, producers are bracing for a two-fold impact, with European exports to the US set to fall, and the region’s imports set to rise as metal is re-routed away from the US.

>“We can indeed expect the EU market – already saturated with cheap steel imports from Asia, North Africa and the Middle East — to be further flooded as steel intended for the US market is redirected because of the new tariffs,” a spokesperson for industry lobby group Eurofer said.

>During the first Trump presidency, for every three tons of steel deflected from the US market because of tariffs, two tons went to the EU, the spokesperson said.

>Aluminum producers are also bracing for a surge in imports, particularly from Canada, which typically supplies more than half of the aluminum that the US imports.

>The metals tariffs apply worldwide, with effects extending to economic rivals as well as close US allies. Major Asian producers including South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia held off on retaliating. The UK said it would focus on “rapidly negotiating a wider economic agreement.”

>For the EU, the fight over American metals tariffs started in 2018 during Trump’s first term, when the US hit steel and aluminum exports with duties, citing national security concerns. At the time, officials in Brussels scoffed at the notion that the EU posed such a threat.

>The 27-nation bloc retaliated by targeting politically sensitive companies with retaliatory duties, including Harley-Davidson Inc. motorcycles and Levi Strauss & Co. jeans.

>The two sides agreed to a temporary truce in 2021 under President Joe Biden, when the US partly removed its measures and introduced a set of tariff-rate quotas above which duties on the metals are applied, while the EU froze all of its restrictive measures.

Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%. His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce. The U.S. president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging “reciprocal” rates starting on April 2.

Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable on Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.

“The higher it goes, the more likely it is they’re going to build,” Trump told the group. “The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That’s a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.”

A fresh flurry of trade-policy headlines touched off another volatile trading day on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 Index’s three-week selloff briefly reaching 10% before a late rally pared the drop.

The equity benchmark ended lower by 0.5%, after earlier falling as much as 1.5%. That had it on track to meet the accepted definition of a correction, which would be the first since late 2023.

On the Earnings Day report SNAP has seen 13.40 USD during after market however after that the price came lower in an unexpected way.

SNAP hasn't seen any 2 consecutive green daily candles since the Earnings Report.

Here is the good and bad news about SNAP:

Good News:

1. SNAP is likely to beat the upcoming earnings report expectations and become more profitable.
2. Price extremely low standing below 9 USD.
3. Due to China Tariffs, TikTok likely will not be sold to the US. Future Ad revenue from TikTok is likely to flow into SNAP and META.
4. SNAP has growing user base.
5. The company does not have political stance (Spiegel was not at Trump inauguration) It is unknown if Trump cares about the markets and the stocks/companies he talks about got negatively affected recently.
6. New Generative Video Announcement
7. 26% revenue increase in India

Bad News:

1. Executives are still selling the stock.
2. The company does not have any political stance. (Spiegel was not at Trump inauguration) Might keep going down because pro republican companies seem like they will be going up sooner.
3. The price is not going up despite being too low. It's almost as if SNAP got decoupled from the market and heading down on its own.
4. Oracle recently announced they would help Tiktok with the operations.

**Main Takeaways:**

* The essence of wealth in modern society is the proportion of purchasing power within the economy, not static assets like land or cash. As a value investor, your goal should be to hold shares of the most dynamic companies in the most vibrant economies to preserve and grow your purchasing power globally.
* China's current economic challenges stem from its transition through the middle-income stage (what Li calls ""stage 2.5""), which is characterized by a significant mismatch between compound economic growth and slower evolution in social governance, human psychology, and political systems. The mismatch between rapid economic transformation and slower institutional evolution is not unique to China but a universal challenge faced by all countries during this transitional phase.
* A sound, complete capital market based on credibility is crucial for converting substantial savings into consumption and investment to drive economic growth. Hong Kong provides China with a historical opportunity similar to what the Netherlands offered Britain, as it already possesses all the elements of a modern capital market including legal systems, dispute resolution mechanisms, established intermediaries, and international trust.
* The distinction between ""virtual"" and ""real"" economies becomes obsolete as economies mature, as demonstrated by how companies like NVIDIA (considered part of the virtual economy) can exceed the combined market value of all publicly listed companies in major industrial nations. Such outdated dichotomy represents one of many conceptual paradigms that must evolve during economic transition to avoid hindering development.
* Value investing was born during periods of extreme macroeconomic turbulence, with founders like Ben Graham and John Maynard Keynes developing their methodologies during the Great Depression and World War II. Turbulent, confusing macro environments of such periods actually highlight the advantages of value investing, allowing practitioners to find significantly mispriced assets.
* China faces challenges in converting its high savings rate (around 50%) into consumption, as personal consumption accounts for only 40% of GDP compared to 60% in India and over 70% in the United States. Increasing the proportion of personal consumption in GDP remains crucial for achieving organic, self-perpetuated, sustainable economic growth, which represents the ultimate KPI of true modernization.
* The market economy stands as the greatest system invention in human history, transforming individual pursuit of self-interest into societal benefit through optimal resource allocation and continuous economic growth. Market economies have been repeatedly proven through various social experiments over the past centuries, and society need not criticize or deny these established consensuses or pay the price of violating common sense again.
* Six fundamental principles of value investing include: understanding stocks as ownership in companies, using Mr. Market to serve rather than guide you, ensuring sufficient margin of safety, staying within your circle of competence, ""fishing where the fish are,"" and recognizing wealth as proportion of purchasing power. Decades of practice by investors like Graham, Keynes, Buffett, Munger, and Li Lu himself have developed these principles.
* The economy functions as an interconnected chain of nodes, including entrepreneurial spirit, consumer confidence, bureaucratic incentives, foreign capital trust, and international relations. Every node serves as both ""chicken"" and ""egg"" (both cause and effect), meaning stimulating any node can ignite the entire economic chain, yet China's current challenge lies in the relative stagnation of all nodes.
* Value investors play a crucial role in the capital market by enabling its price discovery function and connecting valuable companies with individual savers. Without value investors who earn what they deserve, the capital market loses its effectiveness and can no longer turn savings into productive societal resources, making them indispensable partners to outstanding enterprises.",0,,2025-03-11,0.34,0.9976,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.5044,0.0,0.2522,62.61,positive

They don’t actually make money from trading stocks, and it’s obvious why because if they were truly profitable and consistently beating the market, they wouldn’t be selling you a course or subscription to a trading channel. They’d be running their own nine or ten-figure hedge fund or managing billion-dollar+ accounts for big banks if they were truly profitable and yielding 30-100% returns daily like they advertise.

They’re not in it to “help the little guy” or “take control of their life.” Selling courses is just their business model—*you* are the product. Your purchase funds their lifestyle, not their trading success. Most of them rent luxury cars, penthouses, and business-class flights, piling up credit card debt to maintain the illusion of wealth. A few do make real money, but not from trading, just from selling the dream of financial freedom.

It’s an easy trap, especially for people struggling and down bad in life, as these people are the easiest to manipulate. The idea of making a fortune from home, being your own boss, and escaping the 9-to-5 is incredibly tempting. No one exploits that better than these so called “trading gurus.”

A prime example is Aristotle Investments, who preys on low-income African Americans who have zero on knowledge of derivatives, selling them the fantasy of overnight success with the riskiest asset class possible (options). Everything they do is a scam and meant to project and certain marketing image of success. All of these trading pages buy followers, pay for promotions on meme pages, clean up their Google search results, have bot armies for their comments and pay for Chinese bots to pump up video views. Their 'live trading' isn't real. EVERYTHING they do is a facade. Others, like Timothy Sykes, were among the first to popularize this scam. The truth is, anyone selling a day trading course (or any almost any course) on social media is a fraud. Ironically, most of them don’t even rely on trading themselves—they park their money in index funds, because that’s what actually works for anyone worth less than eight figures. There are actually decent pages run by people who have good intentions such as TheMarketHustle, who advertise simple methods of index investing which is what 99.99% of people should be listening to, not day trading options or even buying individual stocks. 

The scam has become so popular and oversaturated that now scammers are teaching others how to start their own social media day trading scam and sell courses themselves. There’s an entire market built around projecting an image on social media and selling bullshit courses of all sorts. It's people who refuse to get real jobs and instead make a living scamming others.

stocks,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,1j8vxgn,JRshoe1997,2025-03-11 13:12:13,433,0.95,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8vxgn/trumps_doj_wants_a_google_breakup_but_is_willing/,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

stocks,Waymo expands robotaxi service in Silicon Valley,1j8v68z,Puginator,2025-03-11 12:41:32,27,0.86,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8v68z/waymo_expands_robotaxi_service_in_silicon_valley/,"Waymo on Tuesday announced it is expanding its service to include another 27 square miles of coverage around the San Francisco Bay Area.

With the expansion, Waymo will now take passengers around Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto and parts of Sunnyvale, California. The Alphabet-owned company opened its robotaxi service to the general public in San Francisco in June.

Waymo will initially limit the availability of its Silicon Valley service to users of the Waymo One app who are residents with ZIP codes in the area, the company said. Waymo plans to serve more riders across the region over time. The fleet of vehicles that will be in use in the new coverage areas are fully electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with Waymo’s fifth generation of self-driving sensors, software and other technology.

“Opening our fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Silicon Valley marks a special milestone in our Bay Area journey,” Waymo product chief Saswat Panigrahi said in a statement. “This is where Waymo began and where we’re headquartered.”

Waymo expanded its San Francisco Bay Area robotaxi service last summer into Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma. Its robotaxis do not yet carry passengers to San Francisco International Airport.

A spokesperson told CNBC that Waymo is in “active discussions with SFO,” and added that the company is “working to connect” Silicon Valley and San Francisco to “provide seamless autonomous rides across more of the Bay Area in the future.”

Waymo also recently launched a commercial robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, just in time for the city’s annual South by Southwest festival.

While would-be competitors including Elon Musk’s automaker Tesla, and Amazon-owned Zoox, are continuing their own robotaxi testing and development, Waymo has pulled far ahead of self-driving companies in the U.S. 

Before Tuesday’s expansion, Waymo said it was serving more than 200,000 paid trips per week across San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.

Alphabet doesn’t disclose financial results for the autonomous vehicle business, but Waymo is part of its “Other Bets.” That business unit generated $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and incurred operating losses of $1.17 billion, according to the company’s most recent financial filing.

>""As I reflect on my journey since co-founding Asana nearly 17 years ago, I'm filled with immense gratitude,"" Moskovitz said in a statement. ""Creating and leading Asana has been more than just building a company — it's been a profound privilege to work alongside some of the most talented minds in the industry.""

>Asana said fourth-quarter sales rose 10% year over year to $188.3 million, which was in line with analysts' estimates. The company said its adjusted earnings per share was breakeven, ahead of analysts' estimates of a loss of one cent per share.

>Asana said it expects fiscal first-quarter revenue of $184.5 million to $186.5 million, trailing analysts' expectations of $191 million.

>Asana's stock price was down more than 25% in after-hours trading Monday.

\- AGI will happen

\- Capitalism will still be there

By AGI I mean mostly the result of massive productivity gains in terms of coding or other office jobs. If you think about what this means for the tech sector, it would mean that the supply side will be massively flooded. Which means that the price will go down for software in general.

Or in concrete terms: If a few AI agents can code up reasonable complex software like a photo editor or excel, then people will exploit that instantly and try to sell it for cheaper than the existing products. If you can spent 10k in AI token to get 95% of photoshop, you could sell it for much cheaper than Adobes monthly sub.

The prices for all software and for everything than can be create with a computer will be driven down to a fraction of what they are now.

But there is one thing that AI cannot create: Raw materials.

Saw these move mainly due to recession fears and the entire market panicking, MASSIVE move yesterday.

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.

[**ASAN (Asana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASAN&p=d)

CEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades.

Background:  I'm a full time employee who took 5 figures of savings and was fortunate to take them to 6 figures during covid.  I mostly did this by only researching the absolute basics of investing (different types of investments, terminology, dollar cost averaging, risk reward stuff and downside protection), coupled with diligence in waking up early to read news and trade, gut feelings and intuition, and a good dose of luck. I'm mostly a long term trader atm with a smaller portion of my portfolio in speculation stocks. 

I also understand the phrase ""every investor is a genius after a crash"" or to that point.   Since the 2020-2021 crazy runups I've sold most of my risky stuff and parked 90% of my port in blue chips, dividends, and the like. My goal is to generate enough passive income to free up time. 

Now to the meat:  The current market doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me. Stocks go down on good news, up on bad news, companies with giga low EPS seem to have massively bloated market caps, and generally, outside of the general turmoil of global and Trump politics, stocks seem to behave in a way i often can't fully understand. A lot of finance jargon is dropped in forums and news stories that i don't always fully understand. I'd like to have more ammo to bring to the table for stocks in general, but especially mid cap speculations.

So my questions are

1 - is it generally worth my time to take a course or read lots on advanced investment strategies as a blue collar?  Or should i simply keep it simple?

2 - if it is worth it, what are good and affordable books, resources, or online courses i could take?

3 - is the stock market just a different beast today than it was 30 years ago, IE has AI, online retail investors, dark pools and other tomfoolery just made speculation stocks too crazy to understand?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Just a reminder that every year there's a 10% Sp500 correction typically associated with some sort of recession fear in the FUTURE. We had it in Aug 2024 when we had nonfarm payroll print 12k, which was a hard economic data that actually showed the econ was very close to or already in a recession. The Fed then proceeded to cut 50 basis points, and it turned out to be data noise. We also had one in Sept 2023 when people thought the Fed was gonna go overboard with the rate hikes and engineer a recession.

Today, we have actual fairly strong econ data. Nonfarm payroll solidly around 150-200k, GDP around 1.5-2%. Even if Trump tariffs hold, most economists anticipate it to subtract 0.5-1% from GDP growth, and add 0.5-1% to PCE. That is a weak economy, a little closer to a 0% GDP than we want, but certainly NOT a recession, and that's IF all of Trump tariffs hold.

If you listen to what most professional economists are saying, not that they're correct all the time, most are simply revising up their recession probabilities from 15-20% to 25-30% (the lowest the probability can be is 15% by the way). For them to forecast a recession as their BASE CASE, the probability has to be around 65%, which is what happened in late 2022, and even then we didn't get a recession.

Furthermore, Powell and the Fed have demonstrated that they are way more concerned about recession risks than inflation risks. The fact that they are willing to tolerate above 2.0% inflation for years, continuously moving the deadline from 2024 to 2027, shows this. In Sep 2024, they were willing to surprise the market and start the rate cuts at 50 basis points as a pre-emptive measure, when the economy was clearly fine. Just last Friday, Powell didn't even show any sign of concern about recession risk. So if you're concerned that a recession is imminent, it's really not. You can listen to any economist talk about this.

What is happening is the RISK of recession has increased, and the market has to price in a higher probability of recession accordingly, leading to the decline. Uncertainty has also increased, and market also has to price in some premiums for uncertainty. That's what leading to the drop, which can quickly reverse.

So if you're feeling worried, I suggest you look at SP500 history, see when the 8-10% corrections happened in the last several years, and see what kind of posts/discussions occurred near the bottom of those corrections. As of today, SP500 has corrected 10% overnight, and I think the bottom is pretty much here, or very near.

Whether or not a recession will happen in the next 6-12 months is undecided, but SP500 typically doesn't start pricing that in until it's right at the doorstep.",0,,2025-03-10,0.0,-0.9929,0.0,-0.8709611296653748,0.75,0.25,-0.248225,-0.2177402824163437,-0.23298264120817186,38.3508679395914,negative

stocks,Oracle misses on earnings and issues weak revenue guidance,1j8fi18,Puginator,2025-03-10 21:38:08,36,0.94,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8fi18/oracle_misses_on_earnings_and_issues_weak_revenue/,"Oracle issued quarterly results on Monday that trailed analysts’ estimates and gave a forecast that came up short of expectations.

Here is how Oracle did compared to LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.49 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.13 billion vs. $14.39 billion expected

Revenue increased 6% from $13.3 billion in the same period last year. Net income rose 22% to $2.94 billion, or $1.02 a share, from $2.4 billion, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle’s cloud services business jumped 10% from a year earlier to $11.01 billion, accounting for 78% of total sales.

The company’s cloud infrastructure segment, which helps businesses move workloads out of their own data centers, has been booming due to demand for computing power that can support artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit increased 49% from a year earlier to $2.7 billion.

“We are on schedule to double our data center capacity this calendar year,” Oracle Chair Larry Ellison said in a release. “Customer demand is at record levels.”

In January, President Donald Trump announced plans to invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the U.S. in collaboration with Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. The first initiative of the joint venture, called Stargate, will be to construct data centers in Texas, an effort that is already underway, Ellison said during the announcement at the White House.

Oracle said it has more than $130 billion in remaining performance obligations after signing $48 billion in contracts during the period. That excludes contracts related to Stargate, Oracle CEO Safra Catz said on the call with analysts.

Oracle will spend around $16 billion in capital expenditures this year, which is a little more than double the total from last year, Catz added.

“As always, we remain careful to pace and align our CapEx investments appropriately and in line with booking trends,” Catz said.

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue to grow of between 8% and 10%. Analysts were expecting growth of about 11% to $15.91 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.65 per share. Analysts were calling for adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.

Catz said Oracle’s fourth quarter adjusted earnings projections were negatively impacted by losses from an investment in another company.

Oracle’s cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.1 billion in revenue during the quarter, down 10% year over year.

The company also said it is increasing its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share from 40 cents.

As of Monday’s close, Oracle’s stock is down almost 11% year to date.

With the Nasdaq suffering its steepest drop since 2022 on Monday, the seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Recession fears and concerns about a trade war drove the selloff.

Apple led the megacap losses, with its value plummeting by about $174 billion. Nvidia shaved off almost $140 billion in market value and shares closed down 5%. The leading AI chipmaker has lost nearly a third of its value just two months after notching a fresh high in January.

Tesla had the biggest percentage loss, with shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbling 15%, their worst day since 2020. The company has lost more than half its value since its stock price peaked in mid-December**.** The stock is also coming off its longest weekly losing streak in history as a public company.

Tesla lost $130 billion in value on Monday, while Microsoft and Alphabet lost $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively. Amazon lost $50 billion and Meta lost $70 billion.

Alphabet and Meta dropped more than 4% on Monday, while Microsoft and Amazon dropped at least 2% each. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell more than 4%, entering correction territory. Shares are more than 14% off their high.

Heavy selling intensified across the tech, with the Nasdaq falling to a six-month low. Many tech companies rely on parts and manufacturing overseas and new levies could push up prices. That’s also sparked worries of a U.S. recession, which Trump didn’t rule out over the weekend.

Semiconductor makers have also felt the pain, with the sector a primary target of new tariffs. Last week, the president announced an additional $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and called the company the “most powerful” in the world as he looks to boost domestic production.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has plunged 3% over the past week and is down more than 16% since the inauguration. Heavy selling rattled the sector again Monday, with the ETF last down roughly 5%. Marvell Technology shed 8%, while ASML Holding and Micron Technology slumped more than 6% each. Broadcom fell 5%.

I’m here to argue, inflation is dead and whatever this is, is looking like a regular recession.

There is no better gauge of future inflation than the actual prices people are paying for inputs.

2. 1 Year Inflation Expectations - 2.73%

3. Long Term Bonds

TLT is up 4% YTD, rallied strong today. In 2022 TLT was clobbered as inflation was driving rates higher

4. Inflation Nowcast 2-3% annual depending on various measures

https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting

The only major data point I can find where inflation has legs is in the precious metals markets. Been in an uptrend since market lows in 2022.

If we think inflation will continue to drop and the economy will slow, we should expect bonds to finally be back.

At this point, tariffs are well understood and even expected, yet none of the inflation numbers have turned. While I’m not saying we will or won’t have a recession, I’m simply saying the narrative of tarries causing inflation causing a recession doesn’t seem to match the data.

**Tesla Brand Damage**  
Tesla is Musk.  His comments in the media and related actions with DOGE have deeply hurt the Tesla brand.  If you look at Tesla's core audience it is left leaning, environmentally conscious Democrats.   Musks actions have completely alienated that demographic.   The Republicans aren't buying EV's and certainly not enough to offset a loss from the left.   A close analogy would be Bud Light and Trans Activist Dylan Mulvaney.   Sales dropped 30% and still haven't fully recovered.   Bud Light eventually fired the executives responsible for the campaign.   But there is next to 0 chance the Tesla Board jettisons Musk, as he has stacked the board with family members and loyalists.

Antidotally, I live in the Bay Area.  My social circle is left leaning White Collar professionals, Tesla's key demographic, and talking with co-workers/friends I don't know anybody who is planning to buy a Tesla.   I have some friends who have Tesla's but when their lease is up they don't plan on renewing or buying another one.   In my view Musk's political activism has permanently harmed the Tesla Brand.

  
**Valuation**  
Tesla EPS was $2.05 last year and currently trades at a P/E ratio of 108.  For comparison Toyota trades at a P/E ration of 7, Ford 6, and Mercedes at 5.    Stocks can trade at high P/E ratios based on rosy growth rates.   Musk has long touted that Tesla is an AI and RoboTaxi company, it's part of why Tesla trades at such lofty valuations.   However, I checked Tesla's 10k and 90% of their revenue comes from Automotive and Automotive Services.   They are very much a car company.       

Even if you were to say Tesla deserves a premium valuation of 20x earnings, that would put a valuation of \~$41, which is a sharp drop from where it currently trades at $222.15.   Yes, Tesla is a Meme Stock and traditional valuation metrics don't apply (i.e Gamestop).   But here's the rub.   Automotive companies have huge fixed costs.   Those factories and plants, cost a lot to build and finance.   A large drop in sales can get ugly real fast and generate huge losses.   There's no way to justify these lofty valuations when your sales are dropping and your company starts hemorrhaging  money.  At some point the illusion cracks.

On Friday, Tesla wrapped up a seventh straight week of losses, its longest losing streak since debuting on the Nasdaq in 2010. The stock has fallen every week since CEO Elon Musk went to Washington, D.C., to take on a major role in the second Trump White House.

Since peaking at $479.86 on Dec. 17, Tesla shares have lost more than 50% of their value, wiping out upward of $800 billion in market cap. Monday marked the stock’s seventh worst day on record.

Tesla led a broader slump in U.S. equities, with the Nasdaq tumbling almost 4%, its steepest decline since 2022.

The downdraft in Tesla’s stock on Monday was tied to uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s plans on tariffs. Canada and Mexico are key markets for automotive suppliers, and increased tariffs, with the potential for a trade war, will likely affect production and lead to higher prices.

Tesla is also dealing with brand erosion due to Musk’s incendiary political rhetoric and his extensive work with the Trump administration, where he is leading up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has become the public face of the administration’s effort to dramatically shrink the federal government’s workforce, spending and capacity.

Meanwhile, Musk has used his social network X to level accusations against judges whose decisions he did not like and promoted false Kremlin talking points about Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Activists and former Musk fans have protested at Tesla facilities across the U.S., and Tesla vehicles and facilities have been the apparent targets of vandalism and arson attempts. Repeated arson attempts and instances of vandalism occurred at a Tesla store and service center in Loveland, Colorado, most recently on March 7, police told CNBC.

Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Monday that recent reports of vandalism could hurt demand.

“When people’s cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,” Kallo said.

Analysts at Bank of America’s wrote in a report on Monday that Tesla’s new vehicle sales plummeted about 50% in Europe in January from a year earlier, partly owing to growing distaste for the brand. The firm also noted that some prospective customers are waiting for the new version of the Model Y.

Tesla’s Model Y, which is a small SUV, remained the best-selling battery electric vehicle globally in January. It was followed by China’s Geely Geome, which surpassed the Tesla Model 3 sedan for the month.

Global sales of electric vehicles, including fully electric and plug-in hybrid models, increased 21% in January from a year ago, even as Tesla’s sales declined. The growth was driven by demand in Europe, according to Bank of America.

stocks,Trump set to meet with Wall st execs and Top CEOs on Tuesday,1j8aimn,haych-18,2025-03-10 17:51:25,1299,0.94,563,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8aimn/trump_set_to_meet_with_wall_st_execs_and_top_ceos/,"Donald Trump meeting with top CEOs and Wall Street executives on Tuesday, March 11, 2025, comes at a time when the stock market is jittery—$1.75 trillion wiped out, recession odds climbing to 39%, and uncertainty over tariffs shaking investor confidence. The Business Roundtable meeting is a chance for Trump to pitch his economic vision directly to the heavy hitters of American business. How this affects the stock market, and why it might actually be a good thing, depends on a few key factors.

How It Could Affect the Stock Market
1. **Short-Term Volatility**: Markets hate uncertainty, and right now, Trump’s tariff policies are a big question mark. If he doubles down on aggressive tariffs during this meeting—say, sticking to the 25% on Canada and Mexico or the 20% on China—stocks could take another hit. Investors might see it as a signal of prolonged trade wars, higher costs for companies, and squeezed consumer spending. The S&P 500, already down 8.5% from its February peak (per Reuters data from today), could slide further, especially in sectors like tech and retail that rely on global supply chains.

2. **Confidence Boost (or Bust)**: If Trump uses this meeting to clarify his plans—maybe signaling flexibility on tariffs or emphasizing tax cuts and deregulation—markets could rally. CEOs and Wall Street execs want predictability. A strong, coherent message about long-term growth could calm nerves and reverse some of the selloff. But if he’s vague or combative, expect more panic selling.

3. **Sector-Specific Impacts**: Certain industries might react differently. Financials and energy could benefit if Trump pushes deregulation and domestic focus, while multinationals and importers (think Walmart or Target) might lag due to tariff fears. The Nasdaq, already down over 4% today, is especially vulnerable given its tech-heavy weighting and those “extended valuations” analysts are worried about.
Why It Could Be a Good Thing
1. **Resetting Expectations**: The market’s been running on fumes of post-election hype—lower taxes, less regulation, the “Trump trade.” This meeting could force a reality check. A selloff now might flush out overinflated valuations (like in tech) and set the stage for a healthier climb later. Think of it as a painful but necessary detox, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at recently.

2. **Long-Term Focus**: Trump’s doubling down on “long-term economic strength” suggests he’s willing to weather short-term turbulence for bigger gains—like bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. If CEOs buy into this and signal support, it could shift investor sentiment from fear to patience. A $1.75 trillion wipeout sounds brutal, but markets often overreact; the S&P 500’s still up historically over longer horizons.

3. **Bargaining Power**: Tariffs might just be a negotiation tactic. If Trump convinces CEOs he’s using them to extract better trade deals (not crash the economy), Wall Street might see it as a win. Lower bond yields—already dropping today—could ease borrowing costs, helping businesses and consumers down the line. Plus, a weaker dollar (contrary to textbook tariff effects) could boost U.S. exports, offsetting some pain.

The Catch
It’s not all rosy. Recession fears aren’t baseless—consumer confidence is tanking, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model predicts a Q1 2025 contraction, and layoffs are creeping up. If Trump’s meeting flops—say, he clashes with CEOs or doubles down on chaos—those 39% recession odds could jump fast. Markets might not give him the benefit of the doubt like they did in his first term when the “Trump put” was a thing.

Bottom Line
The stock market’s immediate reaction will hinge on Trump’s tone and clarity tomorrow. More uncertainty = more selling; a strong, unifying pitch = potential rebound. Why it’s good? It could force a needed correction and align markets with a longer-term vision, assuming Trump’s not bluffing about strength. But it’s a gamble—39% recession odds aren’t trivial, and CEOs might not be in the mood for vague promises.

Historically, this has been a 100% accurate predictor of recessions. Every single time we’ve seen this inversion last for a significant period, a recession followed. The only exceptions were in 1967 and 1998, where the inversion was relatively short-lived, and while growth slowed, the economy didn’t officially enter a recession.

That said, the economy has been holding up surprisingly well despite the red flags. Inflation hasn’t surged even with the added pressure of tariffs, though GDP has taken a hit—largely because American companies stacked up on inventories earlier, reducing net exports. And then there’s the job market, which seems to be the key factor in all of this.

If we look at 1967 and 1998, jobless claims remained stable despite the inversion, which likely prevented a full-blown recession. In contrast, during past recessions, jobless claims spiked right alongside the yield curve inversion. Right now, everything really hinges on how the labor market evolves—if we start seeing a major uptick in jobless claims and deeper labor market polarization, then a recession becomes much more likely.

The wildcard is what (DOGE? lol) does. If they manage to navigate this without spooking the labor market, we could dodge a recession like in ’67 and ’98. But if unemployment starts creeping up meaningfully, history suggests we’re in for some rough times ahead.

This stock is down about 40% in a single month since their last earnings and shows no signs of stopping.

From my understanding, the drop has been driven by a few key factors:

* **Missed user growth expectations** (101.7M DAUs vs. 103.1M expected)
* **Insider selling en masse** (Execs dumping millions in shares last month)
* **General market sell off & post-IPO volatility**

At the same time, Reddit is a **top 10 website in the world** for web traffic, has been rapidly increasing ad revenue, and is now *wildly* undervalued compared to other social media giants. 

So the real question is... what's next?

* Is this an absolute bargain right now, or is there still more room to fall? 
* Could Reddit be the next Facebook, or is it doomed to be another Snap? 
* What would be a solid buy-in price to you?

I've bought about £100 worth at $171 so thank fuck I didn't load up more. Once the dust settles, I think long term I'm going to be loading up a bit as I think people are probably grossly underestimating the amount of cash they'll rake in through their paid subs (onlyfans promoters will go wild for them to be separated from the floods of bots).

That being said, the wider economic outlook isn't great (although I don't see how recession or tariffs should impact RDDT at all outside of less people looking to advertise).

It seems unlikely to end up like SNAP since they're already profitable (unlike SNAP).

There have been market corrections outside of these periods, however, those events are significantly lesser in scope compared to the current analog situations of 2000, 2008, and 2020. 

The Fed Funds rate was held at 6.5% from June 2000 to December 2000. It was 5.25 from July of 2006 to July of 2007. It was 2.4 between January of 2019 and July of 2019. 

As the Fed began cutting rates, in each situation, the market began to decline. However, it was during these declines that illiquidity events took place, causing major panic, and subsequent cratering of markets. 

The 1-point decline in interest rates from peak coincides with February 2001, December 2007, and November of 2019. Each respective recession officially began in March of 2001, December of 2007, and February 2020. 

We hit 1-point below peak in January. There is a strong possibility we are ALREADY in recession, however, genius economists will only tell us this in a year or two. 

In any case, each of these recessions coincided with feat contagion and general panic. Each of these events also bottomed after major catastrophes - in 2000 it was 9/11 and Enron, in 2008 it was Lehman + subprime crisis, in 2019 it was.... that horrible thing that we no longer talk about. 

We are already in the fear stage of the market. 2000's panic was a general meltdown PRIOR to the crises that later unfolded. However, it was those crises that marked its bottom. 2008 and 2020's craterings occurred simultaneous to their crises although stocks did drift down prior to 2008 as well. 

This begs the question: what is the crisis that may or may not occur with the cyclical correction that happens as the Fed cuts rates EVERY cycle? Will it be a true black swan no-one saw coming (9/11) or will it be something like Enron, Lehman, or COVID, where some DID see what was coming ahead of the general panic?

Could TSLA be the Enron of the 2025 bust? It is seeming more and more plausible with each passing day. In any case, the bottom of the market in each of the aforementioned cases occurred simultaneous to the Fed funds rate hitting 0 (or almost 0 in 2003). I expect shelter contribution to CPI to vanish in the next few reports + unemployment to rise significantly, this could give the Fed leeway to put rates back to 0 as soon as Q3-Q4 2025. In both 2009 and 2020 the Fed rate hit 0 when annualized CPI did the same (in March), and March of both years also coincided with their respective market bottoms. 

TLDR; we are far from the bottom, which should occur when Fed Funds hit 0, buy when that happens but before that point, gird your loins.",1,TSLA,2025-03-10,0.0,-0.9714,0.0,-0.9344280362129211,0.75,0.25,-0.24285,-0.23360700905323029,-0.23822850452661515,38.088574773669244,negative

News: [Rocket Companies To Buy Real Estate Firm Redfin](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/rocket-companies-to-buy-real-estate-firm-redfin.html)

**Ticker:** [**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** MSTR has announced an At-The-Market (ATM) program to sell up to $21B of its 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock.

**Technicals:** Watching $275 level, but with all the bearishness in the CC market recently... biased short but no position.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** This is basically an offering. This doesn't dilute common stock but creates a new layer of obligation in the cap structure. Creates a dividend obligation of 8% a year that MSTR might struggle to pay going forward without selling some of their holdings.

**Risks:** The underlying CC price is what will determine if this is a good deal or not in the future.

**Related Tickers:** COIN, HOOD, and other CC related stocks.

**Ticker:** [**RKT (Rocket Mortgage)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT&p=d)**,** [**RDFN (Redfin)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDFN&p=d)

**Catalyst:** RKT has agreed to acquire real estate firm RDFN in an all-stock transaction valued at $1.75B.

**Technicals:** Each share of Redfin common stock will be exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.7926 shares of Rocket Companies Class A common stock (so represents roughly 7% at the time of this edit)

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Supposedly there'll be +$200M in synergy (when the value of the two companies is higher than when they're not), through technology improvements and AI (lol). Deal expected to close in second/third quarter.

**Risks:** The deal is in all stock (which is likely why RKT fell, but expect RKT to gain if the deal is cancelled), so signals some uncertainty and that RKT is overvalued for now. Also remember that we're in a correction right now.

**Related Tickers:** Z

**Ticker:** [**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)

**Catalyst:** NVO released Phase 3 trial results for its next-generation weight loss drug, CagriSema, which showed 15.7% average weight loss over 68 weeks, below 25% target.

**Technicals:** This stock can't catch a break. Watching to see if we break the $75 level. Remember there was similar news back in December 20th.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The obesity drug market is highly competitive, LLY has Zepbound, which is a major competitor that performs better - so the market is questioning what the point of CagriSema is if it can't outperform.

**Related Tickers:** LLY, PFE, SNY

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)

**Catalyst:** SP500 has decided not to include COIN in the index during their latest review.

**Technicals:** Watching $200 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** All the people that bought on hype/expectation that this will be included will sell/pare their position. Changes occur roughly every 3 months. The underlying CC has been on a downturn and there's no large catalyst that we can expect (the White House Summit was a bust IMO) so overall a negative catalyst.

The expansion of the program is subject to the issuance of the Company's audited annual financial report for the year 2024.
""The expansion of our share repurchase program reflects and reinforces our confidence in our ability to continue to generate positive free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet,"" said Tal Jacobson, Perion's CEO. 

""We believe that the current share price does not reflect the strength of Perion's business and the value of our strategic evolution to Perion One.
Perion has a market cap of $400 million and has just announced that it will increase its buyback program from $75 million by another $50 million (12.5% ​​of the market cap) to a total of $125 million.

Finance noob here, so forgive the stupid question.

I've been looking at earning calendars and reported EPS a lot recently and have been using the Nasdaq for a fair amount of research on companies. However, when researching I have found that Nasdaq has different EPS numbers compared to other websites such as [investing.com](http://investing.com) or zacks.com...

Example: Nasdaq says ORCL's reported EPS last quarter was 1.15 and reported EPS this quarter last year it was 1.12. source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orcl/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orcl/earnings)

However, [investing.com](http://investing.com) says ORCL EPS last quarter was 1.47 and reported EPS this quarter last year was 1.41? source: [https://uk.investing.com/equities/oracle-corp-earnings](https://uk.investing.com/equities/oracle-corp-earnings)

Can someone explain to me like a 5 year old why there is such a big difference in these numbers? [zacks.com](http://zacks.com) seems to have the same numbers as [investing.com](http://investing.com), so is nasdaq using a different EPS calculation?

I’ve recently started looking into ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR), and I find it pretty fascinating! Despite the overall market turmoil, ACMR seems to have gained some solid momentum lately. With its position in the booming semiconductor industry, I can’t help but feel optimistic about its potential.

**Company Overview:**  
ACM Research develops and sells capital equipment, focusing on wet cleaning tools for semiconductor manufacturing. Their innovations, like the Ultra C Tahoe cleaning tool, are gaining traction in a market that’s increasingly competitive. Just recently, they reported a 60% jump in stock price following a strong earnings announcement, with net income rising to $104 million and revenue hitting $782 million.

**Key Stats:**

* **Market Cap:** $1.17B
* **Forward P/E:** 12.59
* **Quarterly Revenue Growth:** 31.20%
* **Cash:** $444M (Debt: $188.78M)
* **Profit Margin:** 13.25%

Despite the broader market's fluctuations, ACMR has delivered a remarkable 188% return over the past five years. Their ability to maintain revenue guidance for 2025 between $850 million and $950 million is also reassuring.

**Discussion Points:**

1. With the semiconductor sector facing volatility, do you think ACMR can maintain its growth trajectory?
2. How do you view their recent earnings performance in the context of the current economic climate?
3. What are your thoughts on their innovations and how they might impact their market position?
4. Are there any risks or concerns you see that could affect ACMR's future?

Donald Trump has declined to rule out either a recession or higher inflation while dismissing the concerns of business over a lack of clarity on tariffs, after a tumultuous week in which he watered down elements of his aggressive trade agenda. 

The president insisted industry had “plenty of clarity” and lashed out at “soundbite[s]” from companies expressing confusion over his plans. 

“They always say that — that’s like almost a soundbite — they always say that: ‘we want clarity’,” Trump said in an interview aired on Fox News on Sunday. 

“It sounds good to say, but for years, the globalists, the big globalists, have been ripping off the United States. They’ve been taking money away from the United States, and all we’re doing is getting some of it back.”

The president declined to rule out a recession hitting the US economy this year after the Atlanta Fed warned of an economic contraction in the first quarter of the year. 

“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods, it takes a little time.”

Asked whether tariffs could fuel inflation again, Trump said: “You may get it. In the meantime, guess what? Interest rates are down.”

The comments come after a week of about-turns and an equity market sell-off as markets scrambled for clarity over Trump’s brewing trade war and companies warned of rising prices.

The president imposed 25 per cent tariffs across the board on imports from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday before backtracking later in the week.

On Wednesday he granted carmakers a carve-out from the levies and on Thursday extended that to all goods that met the rules of the 2020 USMCA free-trade deal. Separate 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports are set to take effect this week.

The levies have already caused significant upheaval in the market as companies stockpile materials, review operations and prepare to raise prices. Trump reiterated that the tariffs could rise in future.

“The tariffs could go up as time goes by. They may go up, I don’t know if it’s predictability,” he said.

Trump said in the interview that he had “wanted to help the American carmakers” this week but insisted that no such leeway would be shown on reciprocal tariffs set to be imposed next month. 

“I gave them a little bit of a break for a short period of time . . . It’s a transition into April, and after that I’m not doing this . . . I told them, I said: Look, I’m going to do it this one time but, after that, I’m not doing it.”

Separately on Sunday, Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, conceded some of the tariffs would cause inflationary pressures, echoing Trump’s warnings of “a little disturbance” when he addressed Congress on Tuesday.

“So, will there be distortions? Of course, foreign goods may get a little more expensive, but American goods are going to get cheaper.,” Lutnick told NBC’s meet the press.",0,,2025-03-09,-0.8316,-0.4039,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,-0.7246750000000001,0.0,-0.36233750000000003,31.883125,negative
stocks,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,1j7l0bv,Mountain-Taro-123,2025-03-09 19:35:58,18854,0.96,496,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7l0bv/tsla_being_investigated_by_transport_canada_for/,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

I was invested in this company and made a decent amount of money off of them, until now. Probably slightly red after Thursday and ultimately selling Friday morning.  

After having watched the Athena lander try to land on Thursday morning, and watching my a reasonable amount of money die with it, it was a moment for reflection for this company, and really any others.  Some assumptions I made on LUNR and this landing:

1.) They learned from Odie, their failed moon landing attempt.  Intuitive Machines (IM) did learn, they upgraded cameras and other guidance systems.  They got within 400m of their landing sites on something hundreds of thousands of kilometres away! Impressive!

2.) These are literal rocket scientists and engineers, working with NASA and are probably ex-NASA engineers, should be a safe bet after point 1, right?

Learnings after getting hosed Thursday:

1.) Both 1 and 2 are correct.  Maybe I missed this, but where were their real world trials of this equipment? Why not try to use the same autonomous landing software with orbits around the earth where you have satellites to communicate with or literally watch with? Or use drones to watch with as it nears a landing destination here on Earth?  If there was any activity like this, I would have assumed it would be publicized to help the company stock and profile and also to support the government/private partnership they had, and would have made stock news outlets that I pay attention to; however, maybe I missed it?  The Earth has different gravity and an atmosphere, yes, but you could have tested the software here on Earth and recovered the unit that had dummy weights in it instead of a very expensive drill, a mass spectrometer, and a Nokia cellular network inside of it.

2.) During the landing viewing on Thursday, they mentioned setting up multiple lunar satellites around the moon to help with future missions... Why wouldn't you set those up first?  Seems like better smaller steps to guarantee these much larger, higher risk missions.  Yes, not as sexy as a landing, but probably small (but huge) milestones on the Gantt chart to bigger future missions.  

3.) Assuming #1/#2 to be true, and they had no real world test trials or other information to help aid the landing, did NASA, ultimately send all of their paid assets to the moon on largely unproven systems?  As an investor in the company (a very small investor), did I just do the same thing? 

Not hating on them, I want them to succeed, but it won't be with my money any longer.  I hope their contracts don't get cut by Elon/DOGE/etc that think this is a 'wasteful' program after now having two failed missions.  Afterall, other competitors landed successfully earlier in the week.  

In the current political climate, LUNR seems like a very risky bet at this point, and not an investment, unless there's some laying out of steps to guarantee future success.  Given that the federal government is largely their only source of revenue at this point, it's a massive question mark.  I'll probably invest in BUD instead at this point, they're on a tear since earning.  Even SMCI might be a better gamble.

Yield inversion did indicate a recession, but we've actually gone through most of it and are on the last leg of it now

She talks about how this country used to be mainly funded by tariffs not income tax, with supporting graphs, and that it would make sense to realign with that

She mentions that there will a recession in the government sector for the first time in 30 years since Clinton & Gingrich reduced the size of govt to give us a budget surplus in the 90s. Based on business cycle analysis, anything that goes for 30 years without a correction or a shakeout gets more and more inneffecient over time, and very often there's bad behavior

She believes we are in the last phase of a rolling recession that began in 2022 when the FED started rate hikes. She supports that using unemployment statistics showing layoffs have tripled since the end of Covid, getting to 172k most recently, and in previous recessions we topped out at 240k, Covid being an outlier at 400k

She believes it's basically as bad it can get already, saying that business and consumer sentiment has fallen through the fears over the transition into this Administration and some feeling of chaos.... But federal govt workers make up less than 2% of the nation's work force while sttate+local govt workers combined make up over 20% of employment in the US

She thinks the measures this administration are taking will reduce govt deficit from the current -7.21% to their goal of -2.5%, ""tax cuts and deregulation will turbocharge nombimal gdp growth. The best way to get out of a deficit is to grow at an accelerate with increasing productivity (like '90-2000 which gave us the last surplus)."" She expects another surplus to be coming, if not during this administration then because of it

She states that inflation has peaked, drawing a parallel that ""expected inflation rates 5-10 years ahead are, interestingly again, at the same level when Clinton and Gingrich were wrestling the government sector to the ground."" Oil prices are already going down, with Trump wanting three more million barrels produced in america, and OPEC committing to more production. So gas prices will keep going down bringing inflation down further. Mortgage rates have been dropping YTD and can't go up because housing prices aren't going down

She expects a large rebound in small businesses in the next few years from tax cuts and deregulation, and a productivity boom that takes us into ""new orbit of global real GDP growth."" 7.3% compared to 3% that we've been at for the last 125 years because AI is propelling every other tech

""Strongest bull market in history if we're right""

&nbsp;

I think Cathie Wood has underperformed in typical markets but is very good at timing bottoms (she was spot on during Corona and was way ahead of all of Wall St. in confidently predicting a rapid V shaped recovery). Her funds are specifically geared towards capturing maximum *future* growth, as opposed to maximum returns in the current year. In general, to me it seems she habitually puts out ""best case"" scenarios that haven't always been fully met, and it causes her funds to lag the indexes, but in the broad sense her arguments are usually right (even if some price targets are off)

This was Cathie Wood on March 30, 2020. 7 days after the market bottomed

>""The measures taken by the government will contribute to, what I don't think many people believe will happen, but we do believe - that a V shaped recovery has a much better opportunity of happening now because of these incentives to get back to work and the financial stimulus. . . We were talking about a V shaped recovery before this crisis even happened. Consumer consumption was going up, inventories were going down, and capital expenditure was falling. So we thought there was a rubber band stretching here, and it would at some point turn in a very strong way and we would have a V shaped recovery as businesses tried to catch up to consumers. . . If the policy measures the government put in place clear within a few weeks to a month, then I think we are looking at a V shaped recovery. . . We sequenced this virus in 2 days as opposed to the 5 months it took to sequence SARS, and we are now developing vaccines and anti-viral medications at breakneck speed.""",0,,2025-03-09,0.0,-0.0613,-0.7768405675888062,0.0,0.75,0.25,-0.015325,-0.5826304256916046,-0.2989777128458023,35.051114357709885,negative

>Index rebalancing — often highly leveraged — involves betting on which companies enter or exit various stock indexes, and it can be lucrative for giant multimanager hedge funds like Millennium.

>Yet bouts of market unrest combined with the crowded nature of the trades can also trigger significant losses — even if portfolio managers bet on the right stocks.

>Hong Kong-based senior portfolio manager Jeremy Ma, who also specialized in index-rebalancing trades, has left Millennium, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Ma didn’t reply to a social-media message seeking comment.

>Index rebalancing has soured returns before, including in 2022.

>One fund manager estimated that just a dozen firms deployed the trade in 1998. That number ballooned to at least 50 firms in more recent years — including various pods at the big multimanagers — before deteriorating returns drove some traders away.

People typically think of it as a retail business, but it runs 1/3 of the internet through AWS. And while other companies grow on their cloud sharing platform, such as Netflix, Amazon grows with it.

There is nearly unlimited pricing power with AWS because of the lock in these companies agree to. It’s very hard to switch to, say, Azure.

AWS is the profit center of AMZN, and it’s one of the fastest growing segments of the business in the recent years. High margins here. High demand- leading to high cap-ex leading to a selloff since earnings about a month ago. Well, and the tariffs.

My average cost basis is 187 currently. I own almost 14k of Amazon. But if it trades below to 180-185 region, with already being at historically low PE ratio, and dipping on short term uncertainty despite long term moat, I’m going to sell 7k of my 32k of VTI.

AMD: 2.5%
They’re lagging NVDA, overall risky but they will still grow from AI and could one day develop something to dethrone NVDA. Hopefully they don’t end up like INTC

TSMC: 2.5%
The world’s Fab producer- selling shovels to semiconductor boom. I would have a larger allocation but geopolitical risk is large given china has outright said they will invade Taiwan.

Strong cashflow, wide moat, no other software like it, only getting better with AI integration. Figma acquisition protects moat. 

VGT: 3.75%
Overall investing in tech as a whole, low risk etf. 

MSFT 3.75%
Their monopoly with teams and the whole Microsoft ecosystem is extremely sticky. And their stake in open AI has allowed them to integrate all their products with AI like co pilots. AI will only improve and MSFT will be the first to benefit from it.

“Consider what would happen if you saved $1 every month from 1900 to 2019.

You could invest that $1 into the U.S. stock market every month, rain or shine. It doesn’t matter if economists are screaming about a looming recession or new bear market. You just keep investing. Let’s call an investor who does this Sue.

But maybe investing during a recession is too scary. So perhaps you invest your $1 in the stock market when the economy is not in a recession, sell everything when it’s in a recession and save your monthly dollar in cash, and invest everything back into the stock market when the recession ends. We’ll call this investor Jim.

Or perhaps it takes a few months for a recession to scare you out, and then it takes a while to regain confidence before you get back in the market. You invest $1 in stocks when there’s no recession, sell six months after a recession begins, and invest back in six months after a recession ends. We’ll call you Tom.

How much money would these three investors end up with over time?

Sue ends up with $435,551.
Jim has $257,386.
Tom $234,476.

Sue wins by a mile.

There were 1,428 months between 1900 and 2019. Just over 300 of them were during a recession. So by keeping her cool during just the 22% of the time the economy was in or near a recession, Sue ends up with almost three-quarters more money than Jim or Tom.”

So in essence, hold your course and keep buying a small amount of every month no matter what happens. If you don’t keep buying, you will miss the chance to buy low because you will never know when the low is until it’s too late and the market had already recovered, and if you panic and sell everything you will not get back to the market until it has already recovered and you would end up buying after the stocks are much higher than what you sold at.

> NEW YORK — Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can wait to see how President Donald Trump’s aggressive policy actions play out before it moves again on interest rates.
> 
> With markets nervous over Trump’s proposals for tariffs and other issues, Powell reiterated statements he and his colleagues have made recently counseling patience on monetary policy amid the high level of uncertainty.
> 
> The White House “is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation,” he said in a speech for the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum. “It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy.”
> 
> Noting that “uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high” Powell said the Fed is “focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.”
> 
> The comments seem at least somewhat at odds with growing market expectations for interest rate cuts this year.
> 
> As markets have been roiled by Trump’s shifting positions on his agenda — specifically his tariff plans — traders have priced in the equivalent of three quarter percentage point reductions by the end of the year, starting in June, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch gauge.
> 
> However, Powell’s comments indicate that the Fed will be in a wait-and-see mode before mapping out further policy easing.
> 
> “Policy is not on a preset course,” he said. “Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.”
> 
> The policy forum is sponsored by the University of Chicago’s Booth School’s Clark Center for Global Markets and included multiple Fed officials in the audience. Most central bank policymakers lately have said they expect the economy to hold up and inflation to fall back to the Fed’s 2% goal, with the rate climate still unclear as Trump’s policy comes more clearly into view.
> 
> In his assessment, Powell also spoke in mostly positive terms about the macro environment, saying the U.S. is in “a good place” with a “solid labor market” and inflation moving back to target.
> 
> However, he did note that recent sentiment surveys showed misgivings about the path of inflation, largely a product of the Trump tariff talk. The Fed’s preferred gauge showed 12-month inflation running at a 2.5% rate, or 2.6% when excluding food and energy.
> 
> “The path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue,” Powell said.
> 
> Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who was not at the forum, said in a speech delivered Friday in Portugal that she sees “important upside risks for inflation” and said that “it could be appropriate to continue holding the policy rate at its current level for some time.”
> 
> The remarks also came the same day that the Labor Department reported a gain of 151,000 in nonfarm payrolls for February. Though the total was slightly below market expectations, Powell said the report is more evidence that “the labor market is solid and broadly in balance.”
> 
> “Wages are growing faster than inflation, and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery,” he said.
> 
> Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in February and were up 4% on an annual basis. The jobs report also indicated that the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.1% as household employment dipped.",0,,2025-03-07,0.0,0.9487,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.237175,0.0,0.1185875,55.929375,positive

News: [Us Employment Report For February](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-07/us-employment-report-for-february)

**Ticker:** [**AVGO (Broadcom)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AVGO&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Earnings. Reported EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.49 exp, revenue of $14.92B vs. $14.61B expected. AVGO gave strong guidance of $14.9B vs $14.76B. Cited strong growth due to AI chips and/infrastructure components for training AI.

**Technicals:** Watching to see if we break $200 level today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** I think we're seeing the AI hype become more concentrated in the ""winners"" of the AI race now. There are some companies that ARE citing falling demand for their AI related products while others are stating that demand is still robust. Likely going to see greater consolidation in the future. Major chipmakers like Broadcom are benefiting from hyperscaler investments in AI over the 3 year AI boom.

**Risks:** Tariffs/supply chain constraints make the supply chain far more tenuous.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, QCOM, all other semiconductor stocks

**Ticker:** [**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** LUNR’s uncrewed Nova-C lander, Athena, encountered challenges upon landing on the Moon. (Something to do with their lunar lander not landing at the correct angle, I'm no rocket scientist.)

**Technicals:** LUNR sold off close to 40% yesterday, watching to see if we break the lows at $6.70 premarket. We had 3 major spikes (2 went to the lower) and I'm interested in seeing if we can make any form of recovery today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These exploratory spaceflight companies are insanely volatile and depend on their spaceflights doing well- as seen yesterday.

**Risks:** Technical malfunctions could impact investor confidence and future funding. Delays in future missions or failures in securing government contracts could also hinder growth.

**Related Tickers:** ASTS, RKLB

**Ticker:** [**WBA (Walgreens)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** WBA has agreed to a \~$10B deal with Sycamore Partners to take the company private. Deal is $11.45/shr in cash.

**Technicals:** We saw a strong spike from 10.60 -> 11.20 after the news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Buyout play, but obviously there's not much reward left on this catalyst.

**Risks:** Deal could get cancelled, more delays, regulatory scrutiny, etc.

**Ticker:** [**HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HPE&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.49 expected. Revenue of $7.85B vs. $7.82B expected. HPE’s results were in line with expectations but they cited profit next year would be hurt by tariffs and had weak margins on server sales. Stated IT products from China and Mexico would affect the company’s outlook.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The IT hardware sector is facing supply chain disruptions and rising production costs due to tariff outlook. Easy rule of thumb: the more complex the product (advanced electronics), the more affected by tariffs they are.

It was at a very low point and I thought it would bounce back after the crisis. It didn't, it only got worse but I kept the stocks for quite a few years.

It kind of leveled on a 60% loss since I bought it and just didnt seem to have a lot of perspective based on the news and expert analyses. About 2-3 weeks ago I decided to take my losses and cut it so I sold. I invested in a defence related ETF (which is doing fine enough).

Today I decided to check Air France-KLM again and apparently they published a descent turnover a few days ago and the stock increased 30% in value overnight and is still hoovering around that number.

Ofcourse this would not have leveled my original investment and it might just as easily fall back but still....it feels depressing that after years of waiting I sold out 2 weeks too soon.

What should I learn from this and how can I prevent this from happening again? [And yes Im an amateur]

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Recently, Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve using seized assets, though he made it clear that the government won’t be buying Bitcoin directly, a move that hasn't sat well with many in the crypto community.

Investors are also on edge waiting for the U.S. jobs report and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech, which could give us clues about the economy’s direction and future monetary policy. Meanwhile, the Money Fear and Greed Index is still stuck in the ""Extreme Fear"" zone, highlighting the overall market anxiety.

I’m predicting a weak February Non-Farm Payrolls report, and there’s a good chance the March job numbers could miss expectations too. The job market is under intense scrutiny, and some analysts are already warning of negative news that might dampen any positive shifts from the Fed.

Given all this uncertainty, I’d advise caution with intraday trading today.

My concept is, that by retirement age, I would like to be able to have a degree of income from the dividends, which hopefully won't be so negligible at that time.

I know that for long term building, ACC generally works better as it auto reinvests the dividends. When I do reach a time in life, decades from now, where I want to realise some of the potential gain and start receiving dividends, how would that work?

Do I need to sell, face the CGT then just rebuy the fund under DIST? Would this not likely be a large tax hit?

Here’s how the wholesale company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the quarter ended Feb. 16, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $4.02 vs. $4.11 expected
* **Revenue:** $63.72 billion vs. $63.13 billion expected

Second-quarter revenue increased 9% to $63.72 billion, from $58.44 billion during the same quarter in fiscal 2024. Net sales for the quarter rose 9.1% to $62.53 billion, compared to $57.33 billion in the year-ago period.

Membership fees for the quarter totaled $1.19 billion, up from $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2024, with the company reporting 78.4 million paid memberships and 140.6 million total cardholders. Worldwide, Costco’s membership renewal rate came in at 90.5%, an increase of 0.1% from last quarter.

  
It seems inline with expectations given current consumer spending and tariffs wars.

I also have noticed that every time I see a stock has +200% in the last day, I feel bad and that I have missed a big opportunity. It makes it even worse when I come back 1 day later and see the stock at 400%.

I have had several such bad experiences, each of which have left me with around 500 Euro in minus and even though I am in a small plus since the beginning (I started investing last August with a protfolio of around 10k), I feel that I am not utilising my potential fully.

* **2018–19 Trump Tariffs:**
   * 2018: S&P down \~4.4%, volatility spike, major drawdowns on tariff announcements.
   * 2019: S&P up \~31.5% after easing tensions (Fed pivot & Phase I deal).
* **2002 Bush Steel Tariffs:**
   * \~$2 trillion market cap wiped from S&P 500 (Mar 2002–May 2003).
   * Dow didn't recover fully until tariffs lifted (late 2003).

Takeaway: **Tariffs create volatility & sell-offs, markets rally when resolved.**

# 💰 Large-Cap Index Funds & ETF Flows

* **Passive Investing Dominance:**
   * Continued net inflows to large-cap index ETFs (VOO/SPY) despite volatility.
   * 2018: Passive +$207B inflows, Active –$174B outflows.
   * Record active-fund outflows in acute stress (Dec 2018: $143B).
* **Reactionary Outflows/Inflows:**
   * Brief ETF outflows during tariff scares (SPY lost \~$12.4B May 2019).
   * Quick rebounds once panic subsided.
* **U.S. Stocks vs. Global Peers:**
   * U.S. large-caps generally more resilient than foreign/emerging markets (e.g. China –30% in 2018).

Takeaway: **Passive investing remained sticky; short-term investor panics quickly reversed.**

# 🔄 Sector Rotations

Investors rotated from:

|❌ Outflows / Losers|✅ Inflows / Winners|
|:-|:-|
|Global Industrials, Materials (XLI)|Domestic-focused (Small caps, Russell 2000)|
|High international exposure firms|Defensive sectors (Utilities, Staples, Insurance)|
|Broad equity during peaks of fear|Bonds (Treasuries, short-duration), Money market funds|
|Emerging markets & foreign stocks|Gold, safe-haven currencies (JPY, CHF)|

* **Tariff ""Winners"":** Brief rallies in steel/aluminum producers, agriculture; gains often short-lived due to retaliations & input costs.

Takeaway: **Money flowed toward domestic safety & traditional defensive sectors during trade turmoil.**

# 🏢 Institutional vs. Retail Investor Behavior

|Institutional Investors|Retail Investors|
|:-|:-|
|Actively managed risk, tactical reallocations (ETFs, Treasuries, low-volatility stocks).|Mostly stuck to passive allocation (VOO).|
|Increased ETF use (18.5% to 24.8% asset allocation).|Short-lived panic spikes (record outflows Dec 2018: \~$46B).|
|Quick to hedge & reposition during volatility spikes; cautiously ""bought dips"".|U.S. home bias: kept investing domestically, withdrew from international/EM funds.|

Takeaway: **Institutions tactically managed risk, retail mostly stayed course due to structural (401k, passive) investing.**

# 📊 Macro Context Matters

* **2002 vs 2018–19 contrasts:**
   * 2002 steel tariffs exacerbated existing bear market & recession fears.
   * 2018 Fed tightening + tariff escalation = severe outflows, volatility.
   * 2019 Fed easing offset tariff concerns, investors returned confidently.
* **Global economy influence:**
   * Tariff uncertainty = downgraded global growth forecasts, hurt export-driven EM countries (capital flight).
   * Sector-specific fundamental impacts (""tariffs"" = earnings call red flags).
* **Resolution relief:**
   * Tariff de-escalation consistently triggered market rallies and investor return (2003, late-2019 Phase I deal).

Takeaway: **Tariff impacts amplified or moderated by macroeconomic & monetary policy backdrop.**

# 📌 Core Insights & Patterns

1. **Short-lived Panic & Risk-Off Rotation:** Markets reliably dropped immediately after tariff announcements, investors shifted swiftly to bonds/cash/gold/defensive stocks.
2. **Rotation, Not Retreat:** Investors didn't abandon equities fully—rotated to safer bets. Favored domestic, defensive plays.
3. **Institutional Discipline & ETF Tactical Use:** Institutions proactively hedged, adjusted portfolios via liquid ETFs, buying dips strategically once volatility subsided.
4. **Macro Backdrop Shapes Impact:** Fed policy & economic growth outlook critically influence magnitude of tariff-driven flows & volatility.
5. **Historical Rhymes & Opportunities:** Tariff-driven sell-offs consistently followed by eventual relief rallies. Investors increasingly aware of this pattern, using short-term volatility as tactical opportunities.",0,,2025-03-06,0.0,0.9274,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.23185,0.0,0.115925,55.79625,positive

stocks,Rookie investor: should I think about long term international stocks given the volatility of US markets?,1j4wtlp,WeirdWabiSabi,2025-03-06 09:35:31,3,0.56,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j4wtlp/rookie_investor_should_i_think_about_long_term/,"Basically title: my experience with stocks has been passively contributing to an S&P 500 and toying with some small and big companies for experimenting and learning. I'm not well off, and I'm acutely aware stocks are not a get rich scheme, but I'm concerned that the amount of money I've manage to grow in the 5 or so years I've been in the space could be really wounded by the current administration's choices and plans. 

The impetus for this post came from the US discourse of a NATO withdrawal, among the many tariffs placed globally. My question is with this in mind, should international stocks become a part of my focus? I don't have any confidence that US supremacy will hold over the next 4 years and possibly long after. Europe will need to boost spending to supplement US contributions to NATO and I'm wondering if the relationships between countries will push other industries away from the US.

I did a little more research into what effect this could have on stocks and came across the following post.

What do you think about this and the effects on these stocks?

BREAKING: President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order as soon as Thursday to abolish the Department of Education!

----

""I spent 3 hours researching intensively last night and came up with the following 5 stocks that are heavily dependent on the US Department of Education and could come under considerable pressure today.

Disclaimer: I have now gone short on a few of them.

 ------

""If Donald Trump were to disband the Department of Education (DoE) and transfer its functions to the states, the following companies would face significant negative impacts. 

Here's why for each company:

1. Nelnet Inc.

Nelnet is one of the largest student loan servicers in the U.S. and administers federal student loans.

Eliminating the DoE would mean significantly restructuring or eliminating the Federal Student Aid (FSA) program.

If the states create their own programs, Nelnet could lose customers and revenue because there would no longer be a centralized lending agency.

2. Lincoln Educational Services

This company operates private career and technical schools that rely heavily on federal funding, particularly Pell Grants and federal loans.

Without the DoE, it could become more difficult for students to access financial aid, leading to declining enrollment.

 3. Adtalem Global Education

Parenting company of several private colleges, including medical schools, that benefit greatly from federal student loans and accreditation through the DoE.

Without the DoE, accreditation processes could shift to the states, creating an inconsistent system and uncertainty.

The reduced availability of federal funding could lead to a decline in student enrollment and revenue.

4. Navient Corporation

Similar to Nelnet, Navient is a loan servicer that manages large volumes of federal student loans.

If the DoE is dissolved, existing loan agreements could be restructured or eliminated, which would massively impact business operations.

5. Grand Canyon Education

Operates Grand Canyon University, a large private college that relies on federal student aid programs.

The elimination of the DoE could mean that students from different states would have different access to loans and aid, which could threaten the university's enrollment and revenue.

 Summary

All of these companies are heavily dependent on federal student loans, grant programs, and accreditation policies that the DoE administers.

Transferring these responsibilities to the states could lead to uncertainty, a decrease in funding sources, and an uncoordinated system, which would significantly threaten their business models.

I have with LMT and RTX two US defense contractors in my portfolio. With the latest news from the Ukraine war I am concerned that their revenue will be hurt badly because the US president decided to limit the range of HIMARS.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2025/03/05/abruptly-blocking-intel-the-us-prevents-ukraines-himars-from-firing-for-maximum-effect/

I am sure that a lot of countries will take this into consideration that if you are ordering modern US weapons you are at mercy of the US president.
Maybe some countries will reevaluate their existing orders as well. E.g. Poland ordered 486 HIMARS. 

On the other side the existing F35 orders should be pretty safe because there isn’t an European stealth fighter jet available right now. But selling more of these, at least to European countries, should be hard.

The US plan to decrease the defense budget also isn’t helping both stocks.

But at the end, RTX should have enough civilian exposure in my opinion.

Consumer spending looks to be contracting. People are increasingly price conscious and Target is neither a high end retailer whose customers will shrug off cost increases nor a true value shop that will minimize costs. Target ceo said that they would raise prices in response to tariffs. 



It looks like a perfect storm is hitting Target. A weak consumer. A disturbance of the middle tier retail niche. Inflation and tariffs raising prices and compressing margins. And very poor sentiment among their consumers.

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

stocks,Trump Calls for End to $52 Billion Chips Act Subsidy Program,1j437g9,WinningWatchlist,2025-03-05 08:35:50,6826,0.95,928,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/,">President Donald Trump called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that’s spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp.

>“Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing,” the president said in a prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump implored US House Speaker Mike Johnson to get rid of the legislation and use “whatever is left over” to “reduce debt or any other reason.”

>His remarks were met with applause in a chamber that passed the Chips and Science Act less than three years ago. Vice President JD Vance, whose home state of Ohio won a massive Intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation.

>The Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside $39 billion in grants — plus loans and 25% tax breaks — to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers.

>Trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. Republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as “social” provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements.

>Officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.

>That includes South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in Texas and Indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Company representatives declined to comment on the president’s remarks.

>Trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. Companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.

>On Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC’s decision to invest $100 billion in the US, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. “We’re giving them no money,” Trump said. “All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs.”

>A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment.

>The company originally announced plans for a $12 billion US site during Trump’s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and $5 billion in loans.

>As is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received $1.5 billion before Biden left office.

>Trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that’s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker’s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects — three additional chip plants, plus R&D and advanced packaging sites — won’t win federal funds.

>“The main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,” said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. “One long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It’s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.”

>TSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. — as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.

>Companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad — regardless of who’s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.

>That review is ongoing, and Lutnick’s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government’s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.

>A spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co., which won $406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as “unlikely.”

>But if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, “we would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.”

**My take:** Brutally bad for semiconductor sector if CHIPS is actually repealed, INTC is especially targeted. There'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the US (INTC/TSM/Samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current US chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember INTC delayed their Ohio plant to 2028?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0cq51/intel_delays_28_billion_ohio_chip_factory_in_new/). The US would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. 

This also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (IONQ/RGTI) and AI sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors.

Overall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the US has committed so far (but we don't know much about  the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty.

Goldman is currently the only investment bank working on the sale of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. ports to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

The transaction — with proceeds of $19 billion — includes two ports on either side of the Panama Canal, which Donald Trump has long wanted in US hands.

Data compiled by Bloomberg show that Goldman has historically been the top adviser to CK Hutchison, founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing. One of Hong Kong’s most prominent companies, CK Hutchison trades locally under the ticker 1.HK.

Once the BlackRock consortium showed interest in the port assets, which include the two in Panama and more than 40 others worldwide, there was a rush to sign an memorandum of understanding and file it to the Hong Kong stock exchange ahead of Trump’s address to Congress in Washington, D.C., the people said.


In a statement announcing the transaction, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said the deal resulted from a “rapid, discrete but competitive” process — and was unrelated to politics and reports on the Panama Canal ports.

LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Global growth concerns have shot back onto the radar of financial markets as weakening U.S. economic data and growing trade tensions hurt consumer confidence and business activity.

Although recession is not the base-case scenario for economists, given underlying U.S. resilience, recent data has unnerved investors and U.S. President Donald Trump's new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are exacerbating growth concerns.

A shift in the mood music is apparent across markets.

Oil prices are at their lowest since October , stocks from New York to Tokyo are retreating from recent multi-year highs and two-year U.S. Treasury yields are at their lowest since October as bond investors see increased chances of near-term rate cuts.

""One thing is essential for an economy and that's confidence, which has taken a hit,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Genvil Wealth Management, referring to weakening U.S. consumer and business sentiment.

""I don't think it's (recession) a done deal but it's a reason why we have decided to decrease (U.S.) equity exposure.""

U.S. consumer confidence in January slumped the most in 3-1/2 years, retail sales dropped by the most in nearly two years, and Monday's U.S. manufacturing activity data showed big falls in new orders and employment.

""We don’t think we will see a (U.S.) recession but we do see a modest growth slowdown,"" said Joost van Leender, senior investment strategist, at Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management in Amsterdam, adding consumers were feeling uncertain about ""chaotic"" U.S. policy.

Van Leender said he had trimmed U.S. equity holdings in late January and is overweight Treasuries as yields are likely to fall as the economy decelerates.

Highlighting the change in fortunes, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model estimate for annualised growth this quarter on Monday fell to -2.8% from +2.3% a week ago.

Analysts stress that recent U.S. data is likely to have been skewed by one-off factors such as cold weather, and strong imports in the case of the Atlanta Fed's model. But they also note that a trade war means focus is quickly shifting from inflation to the growth risks from U.S. tariffs.

China has responded to a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20% with additional tariffs of 10%-15% on certain U.S. imports from March 10. Europe is also in the firing line for higher U.S. tariffs, and trade-vulnerable auto stocks dropped 4% on Tuesday after the tariffs on Mexico and Canada, where many cars for the U.S. market are made. (.SXAP), opens new tab

Morgan Stanley estimates that the new U.S. tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada could shave 0.7-1.1 percentage points off U.S. economic growth in coming quarters, deliver a 2.2 to 2.8 percentage point hit to Canadian growth, and push Mexico into recession.

Canadian Chamber of Commerce CEO Candace Laing warned that U.S. tariff policy was forcing Canada and the U.S. toward ""recessions, job losses and economic disaster"".

""Time to add a new word to the dictionary, 'Trumpcession', SEB economist Marcus Widén said in a note.

RATE CUT PRESSURE

The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso briefly hit one-month lows on Tuesday. Notably, the dollar, which has generally benefited from trade tensions, has also weakened as U.S. growth worries weigh .

Some reckon the U.S. economy could be at risk from a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation.

Analysts said a trade war keeps pressure on central banks globally to keep cutting rates to shore up growth. Traders are now pricing in 75 basis points of U.S. rate cuts by year-end versus just one cut in mid-January when data was strong.

After ending February with their biggest monthly drop since late 2023, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are eyeing 4% .

""The bond market is moving towards pricing a soft patch and maybe a recession,"" said Forvis Mazars chief economist George Lagarias.

The European Central Bank is tipped to cut rates again on Thursday and Morgan Stanley said it expects another cut in April as economic data and inflation weaken.

Even if U.S. economic data improves, analysts said the cloudier outlook was reason enough to remain cautious on equities.

Hedge funds that had snapped up global equities have fled bullish bets and put on wagers that stocks would decline, a Goldman Sachs note on Monday showed.

Consumer discretionary stocks, an economic bellwether and indicator of shoppers' purchasing power for nice-to-have products, was the worst-performing U.S sector last month, the note showed.

Friday's closely-watched U.S. jobs report takes on additional significance with growth risks in focus.

Here’s what the company reported compared to LSEG estimates:

Earnings per share: $1.03. The number doesn’t to appear to be comparable to analysts’ estimates.

Revenue: $1.06 billion vs. $1.03 billion

Revenue increased 25% from $845.3 million a year earlier, and the company posted a net loss of $92.3 billion, or 37 cents per share. In the year-ago period, the company posted net income of $53.7 million, or 22 cents per share.

For the year, CrowdStrike said it expects earnings, excluding some items, to range between $3.33 and $3.45 per share, falling short of the $4.42 expected by analysts polled by LSEG. First-quarter earnings are expected to be between 64 cents and 66 cents per share, versus the average estimate of 95 cents.

Despite the after-hours drop, CrowdStrike topped some metrics from Wall Street. The company posted $4.24 billion in annual recurring revenue, reflecting 23% growth. That topped the $4.21 billion estimate from analysts surveyed by StreetAccount and included $224 million in net annual recurring revenue.

Revenue guidance was roughly in line with estimates. CrowdStrike said it expects revenue of between $4.74 billion and $4.81 billion for the year, versus an LSEG estimate of $4.77 billion.

The earnings release comes almost eight months after a technology update from the company led to a global IT outage that grounded flights, disrupted businesses and led to class action lawsuits.

CEO George Kurtz said in the press release that artificial intelligence is becoming more important in stopping cyberattacks.

“As businesses of all sizes rapidly adopt AI, stopping the breach necessitates cybersecurity’s AI-native platform,” Kurtz said.

Now that the stock has fallen to $87.94 USD, I’m in a dilemma.

IRM was still being rated as a solid long-term buy with potential to reach $130 again (which is why I never sold right away), but given the steep drop and the interest accumulating on my credit line, I’m questioning whether I should hang on or sell now to stop the bleeding.

> The world economy could face a crash similar to the Great Depression of the 1930s unless the U.S. rows back on its plans to impose steep tariffs on imports, a senior official at the International Chamber of Commerce warned.
> 
> “Our deep concern is that this could be the start of a downward spiral that puts us in 1930s trade-war territory,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general of the ICC, which promotes global business and trade. High tariffs on foreign goods imported into the U.S. in that decade contributed to a damaging global recession. The downturn plunged nearly a third of the global workforce into unemployment and slashed production at heavyweight industrial economies Germany and the U.S. by half, according to research from the International Monetary Fund.
> 
> The likelihood of a similarly severe blow to the global economy is high, Wilson said in an interview Tuesday. “Right now it’s a coin-flip,” he said. “It comes down to whether the U.S. administration is willing to rethink the utility of tariffs.”
> 
> His comments come after tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico came into effect in the U.S., stymieing hopes of an eleventh-hour reprieve. Fresh duties were also added to Chinese goods sold to the country. Trump has promised to impose similar tariffs on European goods, raising the prospect of retaliation in kind and a global trade war.
> 
> “That puts us in a remarkably precarious position that will cloud the global economy for the coming months,” Wilson said.
> President Trump was voted into office in November after a campaign centred on pledges to protect U.S. manufacturers by raising the barrier for imports into the country from abroad. Trump has repeatedly pointed to the U.S. deficit in its good trade with many partners, including China and the EU, calling those gaps unfair. But economists warn that a steep rise in import costs could cause a renewed spike in price inflation in the U.S.

However, that's on the surface. You have to look deeper to see what stocks and sectors are bucking the trend. Something has just surprised me: telecom and trading-related stocks are outperforming at a BIG level. Check this out:

**AT&T ($T) is up 20% YTD**  
**Verizon ($VZ) has climbed about 10% YTD**  
**CME Group ($CME) is up about 11% YTD**  
**CBOE ($CBOE) is up about 10% YTD**

Let's break this down a bit further:

Telecom and phone stocks are considered to be a bit more resilient in downturns because they serve an essential function: it's how you communicate with friends, family, customers, businesses, and essentially stay in touch with the things that matter most. So, while markets are tanking, some of these telecom and phone stocks are simply ripping. Here's the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/ainzi8xi0pme1.png?width=3020&format=png&auto=webp&s=933fde0b5063825870236f466d566a76dc60ac3c

But it’s not just telecom. **Volatility and trading-related companies are also benefiting from current market conditions.** As uncertainty rises, trading volumes spike, and firms facilitating derivatives trading are seeing direct gains. Futures trading, which CME Group is the leader in, and options trading, CBOE, can thrive in uncertain environments, and the rising interest in hedging strategies can fuel their momentum. Check this out:

I find all of this rather fascinating because while markets tank, there is still some outperformance going on out there. Also, it leads me to wonder what telecom/phone/ VOIP/communication providers might also be worth a play? In terms of trading action, are there other names out there like CBOE or CME? Stocks that specialize in volatility?

TD Cowen analysts in a note Friday said the tech giant had scrapped leases for sizeable data center capacity in the United States, suggesting potential oversupply as it builds out artificial intelligence infrastructure.The brokerage, citing its supply chain checks, said Microsoft has canceled leases totaling ""a couple of hundred megawatts"" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators, the analysts led by Michael Elias said.Microsoft's plan to invest over $80 billion in AI and cloud capacity this fiscal year remains on track, a company spokesperson said.

Their desire is to build out these data centers,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares in Microsoft.Any lease cancellations would mark a sharp shift for Microsoft, which has been spending billions of dollars on data centers to overcome supply bottlenecks that have limited its ability to meet AI demand.The news could possibly indicate lower demand, Bernstein analyst Mark Moelder said, especially after lackluster quarterly results from major cloud companies, but it was also reflective of the capacity build-up at Microsoft in the past years.""Microsoft needed to meet demand and had a great deal of difficulty finding capacity. Management may, therefore, have rented, even at a meaningful premium, data centers and GPU capacity and negotiated more deals for additional future capacity than they needed,"" Moelder added.

News: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. 

**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

Huawei’s revenue exceeded 860 billion yuan ($118.27 billion) in 2024, state media reported, [a 22% jump in revenue from 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/china-huawei-revenue-surges-despite-us-sanctions.html), and the fastest growth since a 32% increase in 2016, according to CNBC calculations of publicly released figures. Huawei typically [publishes its annual reports in March](https://www.huawei.com/en/annual-report).

The company’s revenue barely grew in 2020, and plunged by nearly 29% in 2021.

> SINGAPORE, March 4 (Reuters) - Markets no longer think Donald Trump is full of bluster and are moving quickly to anticipate a slowdown in U.S. and global growth as he raises a wall of tariffs around the world's biggest economy and trading partners start to respond in kind.
> 
> Six weeks into his second term, the U.S. president has hit imports from Mexico and Canada with 25% levies, put an additional 20% tariff on goods from China, threatened reciprocal tariffs globally and cut off military aid to Ukraine.
> 
> But instead of the rising yields and higher dollar that investors had wagered on in November, the so-called ""Trump trade"" is in full retreat.
> 
> Trade conflict has begun in earnest and the dollar is falling while bond yields dive.
> 
> U.S. allies are rattled. As Goldman Sachs analysts note, the average tariff rate on imports from China is now 34% and the increase is already roughly twice as large as that in the first Trump administration. Nobody wants to bet anymore that there will be swift compromises or deals.
> 
> ""It is difficult for markets to get on with aggressive positioning given the risk of U.S. tariff policies turning on a dime,"" said Chang Wei Liang, currency and credit strategist at DBS.
> 
> ""In credit markets, spreads certainly look too low given the change in risk environment and a more adverse and uncertain trade backdrop.""
> 
> Volatility gauges for Treasuries (.MOVE), and for U.S. (.VIX), and Japanese stocks (.JNIV), hit their highest levels of the year this week and implied volatility in currencies ticked higher.
> 
> Stocks and bond yields slid on Tuesday as investors globally ducked for cover.
> 
> Defence stocks ran higher, while shares in technology companies slumped. As China announced retaliatory tariffs and Mexico and Canada prepared their responses, investors reckoned on a global growth slowdown and upped expectations for U.S. rate cuts.
> 
> Futures pricing still implies about 75 basis points of U.S. cuts this year, up from about 50 bps two weeks ago, while 10-year yields hit a 4-1/2 month low of 4.115%.
> 
> Investors see an uncertain outlook where shelter lies in defensive sectors such as real estate or healthcare. And, while protected companies such as U.S. steelmakers may prosper, higher prices will flow along supply chains with unpredictable effect.
> 
> ""I'm spending a lot of time talking to CEOs who are really trying to understand the consequence of some of this,"" said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at conference in Australia.
> 
> ""Until there's more certainty, we have a little bit more runway time. I think we're going to live with a slightly higher level of volatility. But I think he (Trump) has a purposeful direction that he's pursuing, and we should take him at his word that he's going to pursue that direction.""
> 
> **DIFFICULT TO TRADE**
> 
> The fall in the dollar has been one of the most eye-catching reversals as conviction turns to confusion in currency trade.
> 
> What had, in January, been speculators' largest long-dollar bet in nearly a decade has rapidly unwound - so much so that, as of last week, speculators were short dollars against emerging market currencies and held a record long yen position .
> 
> Against the euro , the dollar is down nearly 1% in two trading sessions as the fall in U.S. yields has coincided with rises for European yields since the continent prepares to ramp up defence spending while Trump backs away from Ukraine.
> 
> At the White House, Trump took aim at China and Japan for holding their currencies too cheap. In fact, the yuan , against a basket of trading partners' currencies, is historically firm and Japan has been intervening in recent years to buy the yen .
> 
> But on Tuesday, as the dollar fell, Nomura's global head of foreign exchange flow, Hoe Lon Leng, said it seemed like the ""final blow"" for those hoping for a higher dollar.
> 
> ""That argument is waning and we keep seeing the price action move the other way,"" he said, noting that if both China and the U.S. did not want to see the dollar go higher against the yuan ""then it is going to go lower"".
> 
> To be sure, market gyrations have not been enormous and plenty of analysts do still see room for trade negotiations and an exit ramp from escalation. But the policy whiplash has gnawed away at hopes investors had in a breakthrough deal.
> 
> And nobody can say they are sure Trump is bluffing.
> 
> ""The threat of tariffs has run its course for now, so the next phase is to endure them,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virigina.

Sales dropped to $30.92 billion, down about 3% from $31.92 billion a year earlier. In the year-ago period, Target benefited from an extra week, which has skewed year-over-year comparisons.

For its current fiscal year, Target is expecting earnings per share to be between $8.80 and $9.80, which at the midpoint is more or less in line with estimates of $9.31, according to LSEG. However, it’s expecting sales to grow just 1%, well behind estimates of 2.6%, according to LSEG.

The overall earnings beat expectations but forward guidance has concerns about consumer health. With all tariffs, it's going to be interesting with inflation and consumer discretionary spending.

The market is feeling the heat as Trump’s tariff war escalates, with potential retaliation from China, Canada, and Mexico. Expect these countries to slap tariffs back, putting even more pressure on U.S. businesses, especially Nasdaq giants that rely on global supply chains. Add in geopolitical uncertainty from his halt on military aid to Ukraine, and we’re looking at a risk-off environment. Fear is creeping in, and uncertainty is at an all-time high.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

The company’s Phase 3 program is the largest controlled psilocybin trial to date, but delays and operational shifts have raised questions about its trajectory.

The Bull Case:

	•	Strong early data: The Phase 2b trial showed that a single 25mg dose of COMP360 led to a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in depression symptoms at three weeks.

	•	Regulatory support: COMP360 has Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA and ILAP designation in the UK, signaling regulatory recognition of its potential.

	•	Unmet demand: TRD is a massive market with limited treatment options, creating an opportunity for novel approaches like COMP360.

The Bear Case:

	•	Delayed timeline: Compass recently pushed back its Phase 3 readout to mid-2025, raising concerns about execution risks.

	•	Financial pressure: The company announced a 30% workforce reduction, cutting costs but also signaling potential struggles in scaling operations.

	•	Single-drug reliance: Compass’s success is tied almost entirely to COMP360, meaning any regulatory setbacks or commercialization hurdles could be significant.

Final Thoughts

COMP360 could be a breakthrough treatment, but Compass Pathways faces real execution risks, a long regulatory road, and significant financial uncertainty. The next 12–18 months will be critical in determining whether the company can turn its promise into reality.

The investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company’s first factory began mass production late last year.

TSMC’s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.

Since the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC’s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer—key factors for AI applications.

[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.

“We’re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,” TSMC said in a statement.

U.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.

Trump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.—although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.

“We have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,” Trump said in February.

Since taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent [new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).

Norway can be a reference for other markets in the future but only if Tesla is able to clean up their reputation.

Since administration only started on the 21st, we will only see the real effect of decline in sales when numbers from March are published. Some other countries share car registrations which are from a time point a view much more reliable than sales, since it's unclear if this is about cars being delivered or ordered.

**Reasons of decline**

* (stronger) competition
* oversaturation of Tesla, people want to have another car as the rest
* customers possibly waiting for new Tesla Y 
* Musk

Although oversaturation is less of a risk in other countries, people still steer away from Tesla in favour of different, fresher designs. Tesla is focusing a lot on new tech gadgets/software, while their cars still almost look the same as many years ago.

**Conclusion and near future**

Although it's unclear if the numbers are deliveries or orders in February, we might see a further decline. People that  already decided to buy a Tesla are unlikely to cancel their order. In Norway we might see almost no sales anymore because until new Tesla Y rolls out. In other countries sales could plunge the same as in Norway.

If the decline of sales becomes a trend this will in the short term become a big logistic and manufactoring problem for Tesla.

News: [Trump Heads Toward Tariff Barrage on Canada, Mexico, China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-02/trump-barrels-toward-tariff-barrage-on-canada-mexico-and-china)

**Ticker:** [**RKLB (Rocket Lab)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKLB&p=d)

**Catalyst:** ""Rocket Lab (RKLB) played a pivotal role in Firefly Aerospace's successful Blue Ghost Mission 1 lunar landing by providing its MAX Flight and MAX Ground Data Software suites, which managed critical functions such as commanding, telemetry, navigation, and control throughout all mission phases, including descent and landing.""

**Technicals:** We saw this stock move close to 25% on Friday, watching to see if we have more momentum coming in. This coupled with the catalyst from ASTS makes the entire spaceflight sector worth watching.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Whenever we see these stocks involved in a successful space launch we see them spike. Overall I find most of the catalysts a coin toss but interesting to see multiple on the same day.

**Risks:** Technical delays/failures in the future.

**Related Tickers:** LUNR, ASTS

**Ticker:** [**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) entered into a joint venture with Vodafone to establish ""SatCo,"" aiming to provide 100% geographic coverage across Europe by offering space-based cellular broadband connectivity directly to standard smartphones. Vodafone is a leading provider in Europe/Africa.

**Technicals:** Watching $30 level, interesting to see where this moves in conjunction with RKLB today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Same as RKLB, but this catalyst is considerably lower risk because it's not dependent on a launch.

**Risks:** Other than the JV getting cancelled, regulatory hurdles/competition.

**Related Tickers:** VOD, IRDM, GSAT

**Ticker:** [**IBIT (Various Crypto Stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the US will include three lesser-known CCs in the strategic CC reserve.

**Technicals:** This has caused a bounce in CC related stocks.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Adding these would result in buying in the sums of likely hundreds of millions of dollars, resulting in a massive buying catalyst and for the stocks that hold/deal in them to rise as well. Also note that we've seen a MASSIVE selloff in those markets for the past 2 weeks.

**Risks:** Reversal of news, less than expecting buying, a different bad catalyst, etc.

**Ticker:** [**CPRI (Capri Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CPRI&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Prada is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire Versace, which is currently owned by Capri Holdings (CPRI).

**Technicals:** Don't know what the exact acquisition math is on this, but presumably the move is accurate and not mispriced ($1.6B). Watching to see what it'll do at open but I don't anticipate heavy volume or anything like that coming in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Surprisingly this is a good deal for both fashion houses and allows competition with LVMH, one of the largest fashion houses in the world despite it being far smaller in comparison.

**Risks:** Merger cancellation/deal talks fall through, FTC interferes somehow again like it did when Tapestry tried to acquire CPRI.

**Related Tickers:** LVMUY (this trades OTC)

* Our divestment from Ukraine will give us more resources to deal with China militarily; or
* We're actually signaling to China that we are not interested in defending other countries.

Chinese invasion of Taiwan is always on the table, but some people think what happened on Friday at the White House has just raised that possibility dramatically.

For example, Cramer wrote an article over the weekend for his paid community where he said: 

* ""If I was Chinese President Xi Jinping, I would immediately move militarily on Taiwan, betting that President Trump may switch sides and back China.""

* ""If you disagree with that after Friday’s White House exchange with Zelenskyy, you need to soul search your position. To me, this could be a tremendous opportunity for the PRC to stop this whole game of export restrictions from the U.S. and just turn everything on its head by taking over the island and, along with it, the most important strategic asset in the world right now, Taiwan Semi.""

* ""In a world where Zelenskyy gets thrown under the bus for lack of gratitude and starting a war that he didn’t start, how can we defend an allegedly ungrateful Taiwan? Perhaps because, unlike Ukraine, there is something at stake economically?""

* ""Will President Trump’s advisers discuss the notion that if we care about keeping the Chinese from getting the latest and greatest Nvidia chips, we should care about Taiwan’s sovereignty? Will Trump be persuaded by even cowed generals and naïve national security advisers that Nvidia and Taiwan Semi are of strategic importance? Do they even know that?""

If they were bad, shouldn't the price drop until the money needed to by the stock is worth the potential gains? Similarly, how can companies listed in spy be good? If they provided such consistent returns, wouldn't the prices of the stocks rise until their consistent gains are no longer worth the minute risk they pose?

In the end, if I just buy random stocks, shouldn't my expected growth be roughly the same as SPY? If there was some easy rule of thumb for investing, shouldn't enough people do it to jack the prices up until it isn't much better than investing randomly?

The only reason I can think of that this isn't the case is that there are people addicted to gambling who buy high risk stocks, and thats why stuff like penny stocks are bad stocks.

stocks,Serious question: why do people think Tesla will survive?,1j19zlc,mightyeelstrength,2025-03-01 16:15:49,1167,0.77,1238,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j19zlc/serious_question_why_do_people_think_tesla_will/,"This isn't a highly technical question, but I think it is critical all the same. Why do people think Tesla will survive Musk?

Tesla is already grossly, wildly inflated beyond any other car company--and yes, it's still a car company--and has spent years failing to deliver FSD. That's starting to become a very, very large problem.

And Musk has now deeply and irrevocably alienated some 10-50% of potential investors and customers, some of whom were previously diehard Tesla fans. Those people are never buying a Tesla product. Ever. And you might think they are overreacting, or the salutes where just ""Roman,"" etc., but none of it changes the fact that they are forever boycotting Tesla.

The only two bullish arguments I can think of are, first, that Musk will create such uniquely amazing technology that everyone will forgive his indiscretions. But even if Musk has some unique, amazing magically technology--which he doesn't--who is going to use it? If Hitler has a monopoly on magic carpets, you don't reluctantly buy one. You just walk. Because if you buy the carpet, everyone else is going to think you're a Nazi. Even if you fire Hitler, no one is going to buy magic carpets from former Nazi carpet merchants, not for a very long time at least. And Tesla doesn't even have a monopoly. It's pretty far behind in some key areas.

The second argument would be that his affiliation with Trump will forever protect Tesla stock price. But Trump doesn't have a trillion dollars to give Musk, not that he would, and government largess isn't going to get you very far with extremely limited customers and investors.

So what's the case I'm missing here? Why wouldn't you short the hell out of this stock?

Edit: Thanks for the feedback, this has been productive. The best answer I'm seeing is that Tesla can get rid of Musk once he starts hurting the bottom line. That's a logical line of thought, but I think it is already too late. We shall see when and if it happens.

Edit 2: Friends, you don't have to do this, but please don't think Tesla will just be able to wash all of this with the right PR team and a new CEO. This isn't like Anheuser-Busch having a bad quarter because of a trans model. Tesla and its board apparently let a \*\*\*\* remain CEO. That's on Tesla, not just Musk. ""Never forget"" means never forget.

Edit 3: For stats: [32% of US car buyers today would not consider a Tesla versus only 17% in 2021](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/02/17/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk-politics); [Tesla favorability perception drops from 33% in 2018 to 9% by Jan. 2024 to 3% in Jan. 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-sales-elon-musk-reputation-brand-damage-trump-doge/); [Tesla ranks least favorable among consumers interested in buying an EV](https://insideevs.com/news/749741/tesla-ev-buyers-favorability-rating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); [Republicans like Musk but 48% don't like EVs](https://www.newsweek.com/republican-change-tune-elon-musk-not-tesla-2029028); [60% of UK car buyers refuse to consider a Tesla](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/30/uk-survey-finds-60-of-car-buyers-turned-off-by-elon-musk/); [one in three Dutch Tesla owners want to sell](https://insideevs.com/news/747944/tesla-owners-musk-survey-netherlands/), etc.

Those are brutal numbers. And maybe all of that damage can heal if Musk ever gets ousted. But with tightening competition, there's a point of no return.

Edit 4: Ok, so hard no on the ""but it isn't a car company"" angle. About 88-93% of Tesla's revenue is tied to automotive, meaning  it's actually more of a car company than other car companies, like, say, Volkswagen (15% financial services). Or BYD, which is \~80% automotive with the rest being electronics, energy, batteries, and semiconductors. So basically its a better Tesla.  And Tesla isn't a tech/AI/robot/home company for the same reason that McDonald's isn't: neither of them sell those products.

Or even popular companies that had good results but were misunderstood or weren’t met by with much enthusiasm by Wall Street? None of us have time to sift through hundreds of financial results, so combined, I’m willing to bet we can get a pretty good list of investing ideas here for others to do due diligence on. 

I’ll start with two I own:

PRCH 
Nearly 20% Revenue growth and becoming more profitable. Putting themselves in a position to be a very valuable player in insurance industry with the home data they provide. Recently were granted a reciprocal that will enhance profitability and are beginning to scale out the licensing of their data. At a market cap of just around 800M, I think this is way under-the-radar relative to the strong performance they put in last year.

HIMS
Definitely not an unknown or under-the-radar company anymore. I feel that this stock is still very much in price discovery mode. Admittedly there are concerns I have with this one as they attempt to disrupt big pharma, but they have built a strong brand, and I think the percentage of their total revenue that they generate from weight loss drugs is not proportional to the reaction from Wall Street on the news of the FDA banning them from compounding GLP1’s. This will not harm HIMS as much as people make it out to appear. Their other services and compounded treatments are the core of their revenue and have led to exponential revenue growth in 2024. There are many verticals within the healthcare space that they can continue to grow into. This is one of my highest conviction long term investments.

>The sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.

>Dividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market—excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)—have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.

>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98

>An American multinational pharmaceutical company, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ranks eighth on our list of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds. The company has a diverse portfolio that includes over 10 high-performing drugs across multiple therapeutic areas, such as infectious diseases and oncology. In addition to its pharmaceutical business, the company is a major player in the medical device industry, providing further diversification. Its financial performance remains stable and reliable. Since the start of 2025, the stock has surged by nearly 15%.

>In the fourth quarter of 2024, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported $22.5 billion in revenue, marking a 5.2% increase from the prior year. As a prominent healthcare company, it remains focused on developing treatments for diseases with substantial unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart failure. The MedTech division recorded a 6.2% rise in global operational sales, with acquisitions and divestitures contributing 1.5% to this growth. Strong demand for electrophysiology products and Abiomed supported growth in the Cardiovascular segment, while the General Surgery unit saw increased sales of wound closure products.

>Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s quarterly dividend currently comes in at $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.00%, as of February 25. The company maintains one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market, spanning 62 years.

>Overall JNJ ranks 8th on our list of the dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the [**cheapest AI stock**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/cheapest-ai-stock-with-10000-return-potential/).In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend stocks.

>The sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.

>Dividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market—excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)—have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.

I’m working on some DCF models, but I’m running into a major issue: the difference between the Perpetuity Growth Method and the Exit Multiple Method is always huge. When I use a reasonable long-term growth rate (e.g., 2-3%), I get a valuation that’s way lower than when I apply an exit multiple based on comparable companies. It makes my model feel way off, and I don’t know which method to trust more.

I know that both approaches have their drawbacks—PGM is sensitive to WACC and growth rate assumptions, while EMM depends on the chosen multiple—but the discrepancy I’m seeing is significant enough to make me doubt the whole valuation.

How do you handle this in your models? Do you lean more on one method? And what are the biggest mistakes that can cause a valuation to be skewed?

Would appreciate any insights!",0,,2025-02-28,0.5994,0.8893,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.671875,0.0,0.3359375,66.796875,positive
stocks,"If a stock doesn’t pay dividends, how is it not a Ponzi scheme?",1j0hvzp,AceDenied,2025-02-28 15:47:46,0,0.38,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0hvzp/if_a_stock_doesnt_pay_dividends_how_is_it_not_a/,"After delving into crypto, it made me question the fundamentals of stocks as well.

With crypto almost all of it is effectively a ponzi in a broad sense because most of these coins have 0 inherent value or produce insignificant revenue and cannot justify its multi billion $ market cap

All the money from selling a coin is 99.999% coming from another holder

How is this any different than stocks with 0 dividends?

Legally, there’s regulation, stocks are tied to their company that produces revenue etc (makes it totally different than crypto ofc)

However, financially your gains from selling a stock come directly from another holders money, correct? A company may sell their shares and then use that money to grow the company, but that wealth generation doesn’t directly flow into the stock — it just so happens to after some speculation 

I’m strictly taking about the source of money here

People see earnings report and then speculate what the FMV is and then bid on the stock. If a company buys their stock, they are just participating in the bidding. The stock’s value is exclusively coming from buyers and the only thing that financially couples the stock and company is the buyer’s speculation looking at the companies potential 

Basically, the money you make from a stock with 0 dividends is directly coming from another buyer … how is this not a ponzi, financially speaking?

For example, if everyone tried to sell their stock, the people who sold last would end up losing money because the first sellers would drain the liquidity and the later sellers who may have $1000 before the sell off may end up with like $100. I’m not explaining anything new here ofc, just highlighting common ponzi characteristics

stocks,What will happen in the next 9 months,1j0e9nq,mbacandidate1,2025-02-28 13:13:05,0,0.44,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0e9nq/what_will_happen_in_the_next_9_months/,"No one knows what will happen! That said, you can look at the risks and reasonably conclude that there is an elevated probability of a recession this year. 

1. Tariffs reducing int'l trade
2. General macro and fiscal uncertainty contributing to reduced consumer and business confidence, and thus reduced purchases and investments
3. DOGE-ification trend increases in private sector resulting in more layoffs, and higher unemployment
4. Came out of steepest and longest 10y/3o inversion late last year

So... I think the better question is what data points should we be focused on in the next several months to understand if the likelihood of a recession is increasing or decreasing. Personally I'm watching the below but am interested in other perspectives.

* 10y yields: Bonds are primarily an institutional market. If yields continue to fall then that is telling you what institutions, who have access to way more data, are thinking about the economy. Falling yields = recession more likely.
* Consumer confidence: This metric tracks recessionary activity well. If this continues to fall then we are in trouble.
* Commodity prices: There is plenty of noise here with tarrifs... but if you see copper and oil fall then that may be a sign of trouble.
* Large purchase spending (autos, appliances, etc): This is typically the first place you see hit at the start of a recession as people delay spending on large purchases first.

Of course if you are bogling then all of this is irrelevant to you. ",0,,2025-02-28,0.0,-0.8516,0.0,-0.9583013653755188,0.75,0.25,-0.2129,-0.2395753413438797,-0.22623767067193984,38.68811646640301,negative

>The struggling chipmaker announced Friday that construction on the first of its two factories — known as fabs — planned for New Albany is now expected to be completed in 2030 and begin operations between then and 2031. Construction of the second fab should be done in 2031 and operations should begin in 2032.

>Intel announced the project in January 2022 and broke ground eight months later at the site in Licking County, just northeast of Columbus. The first plant initially was due to begin operating in 2025, but the project has since been delayed by financial concerns, the departure of its CEO last December and other problems. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.

>“We are taking a prudent approach to ensure we complete the project in a financially responsible manner that sets up Ohio One for success well into the future,” Naga Chandrasekaran, the executive vice president, chief global operations officer and general manager of Intel Foundry Manufacturing, stated in a message posted on Intel's website. “We will continue construction at a slower pace, while maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants.”

>Intel has received $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion in funding it was due as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

stocks,Rocket Lab's Stock Fell 25% This Week. Here's Why It's a Buying Opportunity.,1j0a5pn,7innovator,2025-02-28 10:23:40,151,0.79,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0a5pn/rocket_labs_stock_fell_25_this_week_heres_why_its/,"**Rocket Lab** (Nasdaq: RKLB) has gotten a lot of attention in recent years as ""the disruptor of the space economy."" 

First a bit of background. 

Its *Electron* rocket is already launching smaller satellites of up to 300 kgs into orbit, but it's also developing a much larger *Neutron* rocket that will carry entire satellite constellation payloads that weigh up to 10,000 kgs.

Most compare the company to SpaceX, though this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. SpaceX is primarily launching its own satellites for Starlink satellite internet, and it's offering rideshare to anyone who wants to hop on for a ride. Rocket Lab is offering much smaller, dedicated launches for commercial customers and for government defense programs. But it's building a bigger rocket now, which might compete in some cases with SpaceX's Falcon.

So back to what's going on with the stock.

Rocket Lab caught some heat earlier this week after getting blasted by a short report from Bleecker Street Research. Short reports are often short-term financially-motivated, and this conveniently came out two days before Q4 earnings (which during the quiet period, where Rocket Lab couldn't respond).

The crux of the short report is that Neutron's development is taking longer than expected and that its unit economics might not be as advertised. BSR believes the combination of Neutron's debut launch being delayed and it capturing less revenue in its earliest launches will lead to a cash crunch.

BSR went on to disclose that they are short Rocket Lab, but they did not issue a price target of what they believe the stock is worth. [Here is a link to their full report](https://www.bleeckerstreetresearch.com/research/rklb) for anyone who might be interested.

And now, why this is a buying opportunity.

I personally am on my seventh iteration of a Rocket Lab discounted cash flow valuation model and **I am sticking to $23 per share as an objective fair value for Rocket Lab's stock.**

Rocket Lab admitted during Thursday's earnings that its Neutron debut is expected ""in the second half of 2025."" 

That's fine with me, as I'd rather see them get this perfect for the first launch rather than rushing things to hit the deadline. I even expect they'll discount the price of the first Neutron launch to be closer to $30 million (rather than $50 million as is generally expected).

The six or twelve month delay is negligible to the stock price. We're already know that Neutron will take time to ramp up and we aren't expecting more than a handful of launches during the first few years anyway. In a worst-case scenario, pushing the first Neutron launch out to late 2026 or even 2027 wouldn't result in more than a $4 per share impact to Rocket Lab's current price target (i.e. around $19 per share instead of $23).

[Here's a link to see all of my Rocket Lab research](https://7investing.com/company_name/rocket-lab/) and all of the assumptions I've used in my DCF.

Outside of potential Neutron delays, everything else numbers-wise pretty much aligned with my previous expectations. 

There are fewer Electron launches set-in-stone on the launch schedule for 2025, but there are also more of them purposely-unscheduled and reserved for the US Space Force's responsive program (which is higher revenue per launch but also demands a launch within 24 hours). Electron's revenue per launch on Electron in 2025 will also be \~3% higher than it was in 2024.

Within Space Systems (where Rocket Lab manufactures the satellites and components), backlog is ""lumpy"" but is still progressing nicely. New or updated contracts have been signed with the Space Defense Agency and Victus Haze, while the reveal of a new ""Flatellite"" design could be a perfect fit for upcoming constellations launched by Neutron.

I'd encourage anyone investing in Rocket Lab to look at what this company is accomplishing over long periods of time. Rather than putting any of their quarterly results under the microscope.   
  
**The punchline = I believe this week's selloff is likely a buying opportunity for longer-term investors.**

stocks,Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase,1j09c5p,WinningWatchlist,2025-02-28 09:47:56,2652,0.97,299,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j09c5p/skype_to_shut_14_years_after_microsofts_85/,">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.

>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.

>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.

>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.

>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.

>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.

>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.

>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.

>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.

>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.

>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.

>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.

**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",0,,2025-02-28,0.0,0.9796,-0.7042434215545654,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.2449,-0.5281825661659241,-0.14164128308296203,42.91793584585189,negative

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The market overreacts and sells off great companies (e.g. NVDA today). But here’s what I think will happen:

Trump will announce that he’s come to a “beautiful, glorious deal” with the EU, Canada, Mexico, etc. and talk about reducing the tariffs that both sides charge each other. This will make the market POP big time because it will promote free trade. It will be especially good for US technology companies who have been hectored by the EU and outright banned or censored in parts of Asia.

Trump will then work with Xi to create a better trade situation with China in the second half of 2025, where our technology companies IP are protected and the Chinese manufacturing sector is also protected (there’s a reason that 30% of the US’ good are produced in China). He will also relax the export restrictions on US technology, allowing companies like Nvidia and MU to sell the Hell out of China, which will lead to a big pop again. 

Let’s face it, Trump has a huge ego. He’s not going to allow the stock market to tank in his first year. He ESPECIALLY is not going to allow it to tank tech stocks, where is he leaning so heavily on technology people like Musk, David Sacks and Peter Thiel. He even has a great relationship with Jensen Huang now. 

That’s my theory. I think it will remain choppy for the next couple of quarters but by Q3 CY2025, things should be rocking and rolling. I am DCAing BIG TIME into some great stocks in the AI and energy sector until then, while the prices are still relatively attractive.

Clover Health's 2024 results reveal a remarkable financial turnaround, with the company achieving **$70 million in Adjusted EBITDA** for 2024 compared to a **$42 million** loss in 2023 – a **$112 million** year-over-year improvement. This shift to profitability represents a critical inflection point for a company that has historically struggled with high medical costs.

The most telling metric is Clover's Insurance Benefits Expense Ratio (BER) improvement to **81.2%** for full-year 2024, down from **86.5%** in 2023. This 530 basis point improvement directly translates to approximately **$69 million** in additional margin on their **$1.3 billion** insurance revenue base. In the Medicare Advantage industry, where typical margins are thin, this level of medical cost improvement is exceptional.

Clover's 2025 guidance signals confidence in their business model, projecting **30%** membership growth and **37%** revenue growth while maintaining profitability. The upcoming 4.0 Star Rating for payment year 2026 will provide a substantial revenue boost through enhanced CMS reimbursements – typically 5% higher than non-bonus plans.

The company's technology-first approach with the Clover Assistant platform appears to be delivering on its promise of better care management and cost control. Their positive cash flow from operations in 2024 marks another critical milestone, reducing concerns about future capital needs.

While balancing rapid growth with profitability remains challenging in healthcare insurance, Clover's improved cost structure and technology platform position them to potentially achieve both objectives – something many Medicare Advantage startups have failed to accomplish.",0,,2025-02-27,-0.296,0.9936,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.026400000000000035,0.0,0.013200000000000017,50.660000000000004,neutral

# BAE Systems (UK)

* **Performance:** BAE Systems saw **sales grew 14% to £28.3 billion** in 2024, with underlying EBIT rising \~12%. EPS also increased from 63.2p to 68.5p, reflecting strong execution and higher profitability.
* **Backlog & Contracts:** The company’s **record-high backlog of £77.8 billion** (up 11% YoY) represents nearly three years of revenue visibility. It secured £33.7 billion in new orders, including significant contracts related to the AUKUS submarine pact and Eurofighter program.
* **Geopolitical Tailwinds:** With the UK increasing defense spending beyond 2% of GDP, BAE stands to benefit from ongoing investment in combat aircraft, naval ships, and nuclear submarines. It's previously been described as having **""the keys to the back door of Number 10 \[Downing Street\]""**
* **Valuation:** Currently trading at **21× earnings** (historical average \~14×), with a **1.5× P/S ratio and EV/EBITDA around 12–14×**. While some growth is priced in, there remains room for upside if European defense budgets continue expanding.

# Thales (France)

* **Performance:** Thales reported **record-high order intake of €23.1 billion** in 2023, lifting its **backlog to €47 billion** by mid-2024. Sales grew \~5%, with EBIT up \~10%, demonstrating strong operational performance.
* **Backlog & Contracts:** The company secured several contracts exceeding €500 million each, including deals for Rafale fighter systems, air defense radars, and a major 10-year French defense cloud project.
* **Geopolitical Factors:** With France increasing military spending and the EU pushing for greater defense self-sufficiency, Thales is well positioned in aerospace, cyber-security, and defense electronics.
* **Valuation:** Thales trades at a **P/E of 28× and an EV/EBITDA of 13–15×**, higher than historical norms, suggesting much of the expected growth is might be reflected in its stock price.

# Leonardo (Italy)

* **Performance:** Leonardo posted **double-digit growth in 2024**, with **revenues up 11% to €17.8 billion** and EBITA rising 13%.
* **Backlog & Contracts:** Its **order backlog now exceeds €44 billion**, with strong bookings for helicopters, Eurofighter Typhoon exports, and defense electronics.
* **Growth Drivers:** As Italy increases defense spending toward NATO’s 2% target, Leonardo is set to benefit from major defense programs. Additionally, its ownership of Leonardo DRS provides access to U.S. military contracts.
* **Valuation:** Still trading at **20× earnings and only \~1× sales**, despite it's recent impressive runup, Leonardo appears to still be undervalued compared to peers. If it continues improving margins and cash flow, there is **significant room for multiple expansion**.

# Rheinmetall (Germany)

* **Performance:** Rheinmetall transformed into a **rapidly growing pure-play defense leader**, with **sales up 30–40% and profits doubling** in 2023.
* **Backlog & Contracts:** The company’s **order backlog soared to €52 billion by Q3 2024**, nearly five times its annual revenue. Major wins include a **€8.5 billion artillery ammunition deal**, a **€3.5 billion military truck order**, and expanding production in air defense and armored vehicles.
* **Geopolitical Momentum:** Germany’s €100 billion defense modernization effort provides a long-term growth runway for Rheinmetall, particularly in armored vehicles, artillery, and munitions.
* **Valuation:** The stock trades at over **80× earnings,** with an insane recent run. While its backlog supports long-term growth, **valuation risk is high**. I'd probably wait for a pullback on this one but what do I know, I wouldn't have bought Tesla either.

# Saab AB (Sweden)

* **Performance:** Saab delivered **23% organic sales growth** in 2024, with **EBIT up 32% and revenue reaching SEK 63.7 billion (\~$6.2 billion)**.
* **Backlog & International Demand:** Its **order backlog grew 22% to SEK 187 billion (\~$17 billion)**, supported by strong exports of anti-tank weapons, radars, and Gripen fighter upgrades.
* **Growth Outlook:** With Sweden increasing defense spending and expanding its NATO role, Saab is well-positioned. Demand for its Carl-Gustaf anti-armor weapons and air defense radars continues to surge.
* **Valuation:** Saab trades at **35–40× earnings**, above its historical average (\~23×). While it has strong international demand, much of its near-term growth is already priced in.

# Under-the-Radar EU Defense Companies

# Hensoldt (Germany)

* **Specializes in defense electronics (radars, optronics, electronic warfare).**
* **Backlog of €6.64 billion** (up 20% YoY).
* **Revenue grew 21% in 2024**; targets €5 billion annually by 2030.
* **Undervalued vs peers despite critical role in surveillance & air defense.**

# QinetiQ Group (UK)

* **Provides defense R&D, robotics, and test & evaluation services.**
* **Backlog of £2.9 billion**, growing internationally.
* **P/E \~16× (trailing), \~12× (forward).**
* **Niche in high-tech defense solutions, with strong cash flow.**

# Chemring Group (UK)

* **Specializes in munitions, countermeasures, and explosive detection.**
* **Backlog of £1.35 billion, revenue up 8% in 2024.**
* **P/E in mid-teens, trading at a discount vs larger defense firms.**
* **High demand for its battlefield tech and missile countermeasures.**

# Kongsberg Gruppen (Norway)

* **Leading missile and air defense supplier in Europe.**
* **Backlog of NOK 88 billion (\~$8.5 billion).**
* **Major supplier of NASAMS air defense system and Naval Strike Missile.**
* **Strong growth potential as NATO nations standardize on its weapons.**
* **Increased Arctic military interest could mean it's a good speculative Arctic play**

# Conclusion/Outlook

With **record order backlogs and rising military budgets**, European defence is likely to see a rather **significant boom**. Fears of a complete **NATO collapse aside**, EU leaders including **Macron and Germany's new chancellor** are increasingly open and pushing for a **European army**, as it's clear the age of reliance on US defence is coming to an end. I'm going to be creating a mini-etf with these stocks (allocations pending) and seeing how they perform over the next few years.

**TLDR**:

* **Leonardo and BAE Systems** appear **undervalued** relative to their peers.
* **Thales, Saab, and Rheinmetall** have strong growth, but their stocks already reflect much of the upside.

stocks,"Tesla seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, Bloomberg News reports",1iznm3n,Puginator,2025-02-27 14:04:20,1,0.51,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iznm3n/tesla_seeking_approval_to_offer_ridehailing/,"Tesla is seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, a key step by Elon Musk's company to begin carrying paying customers while its traditional car-selling business falters, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

The automaker has approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California, but it does not have, nor has applied for, a driver-less testing or deployment permit from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, according to the report.

Tesla late last year applied for a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, the report said, citing documents. That classification means Tesla would own and control the fleet of vehicles.

The company discussed driver's license information and drug-testing coordination in its communications with California officials, suggesting that Tesla intends to use human drivers, at least initially, the report said.

Tesla and the California Public Utilities Commission did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Musk has in the past year pivoted Tesla to robotaxis as demand slows for its aging line-up of electric vehicles — a high-stakes bet that has lifted shares but could face regulatory roadblocks. Investors are counting on the billionaire's close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump to simplify that process.

Musk had in October said Tesla will roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year, without offering more specific details.

Tesla had in the same month revealed a concept for a robotaxi called Cybercab that will come without a steering wheel or control pedals, as it looks to dominate the self-driving vehicle industry.

Musk has said Tesla will start fully unsupervised FSD in Texas and California this year, without offering more details. He said the Cybercab will go into production in 2026 and will also be available for customers to buy for less than $30,000.

However, with autonomous technology proving harder and more expensive to solve, industry experts have warned it could take Tesla several years to commercialize a robotaxi.

I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: 

- Tesla 
- Shopify 
- Block
- NVDA 
- AMD 
- PLTR
- AAPL 
- GME

I know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. 

 But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. 

The beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. 

Lately it feels like we have entered a new “hype” cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: 

- RKLB
- IONQ 
- BBAI
- CAVA 
- LUNR
- SMCI
- OKLO 
- BRO

I have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. 

It’s a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. 

Anyway, that’s my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions.

Reddit grew a lot since IPO (May of last year) off monetizing ads and is around $30B mcap now (off its $40B highs). The worst case scenario at this point for Reddit is that it stops growing ads and gets to the industry mean \~10x price/sales (so around $20B mcap off \~$2b in sales).

Reddit also hit net income and free cash flow profitability in the past 2 quarters, which means Reddit has a outsized change to get included into the S&P 500. Let's go through all the criteria:

  
1. Market cap - Needs to be a minimum $14.5B. Reddit is firmly above that at $30B and worst case imo is $20B if hypergrowth stalls

2. Liquidity - Needs to have traded 250k shares per month for 6 months (well over this threshold, last 30 days is 6.2M)

3. Domiciled in the US - check

4. Must have positive GAAP earnings for the past 4 consecutive quarters (we're two quarters in so far)

5. 10% of shares must be publicly traded -  \~80% of shares are publicly traded at the moment (\~100M of \~125M)

6. Sector balance - This might be a tricky one, since tech is already over 25% of the S&P 500. But there are a few tech companies at the bottom of the index that might tip Reddit in (like Sandisk)

7. Must trade for 12 months - we'll come up on that this summer

8. Corporate structure - check

  
I doubt that RDDT's management will let it tip into not being profitable - they have enormous R&D expenses already and I don't see that growing more.

News: [Nvidia Gives Upbeat Forecast In Sign That AI Build Out Is Strong](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/nvidia-gives-upbeat-forecast-in-sign-that-ai-build-out-is-strong)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings with EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.84 exp and revenue of $39.33B vs. $38.05B exp.

Provided strong guidance, anticipating revenue of $43B vs  $41.78B exp.

Performance is driven by robust demand for Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, positioning the company to maintain its growth trajectory in the AI sector.

Overall a good earnings report, we're not going to see the stock explode like we did previously with the earnings beats.

**Technicals:** Watching $135 level, other than that I don't anticipate a major selloff due to the earnings news- maybe due to the jobs/macro news instead.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Overall not as explosive as the market wanted it to be. Growth was largely driven by advancements in AI (as usual).

Company said they were still demand constrained, even with export controls.

**Risks:** Potential supply chain disruptions/geopolitical tensions, greater export controls as mentioned previously, and increased competition.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM

**Ticker:** [**APP (AppLovin)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APP&p=d)

**Catalyst:** A recent short report has been released, alleging that the company's application functions as spyware.

This follows a similar report from approximately a week ago.

**Technicals:** Yesterday I was mainly interested in being long if we broke $300 and had a recovery- I read both of the short reports and they said very similar things, so I thought the selloff was overblown.

Bought a little below $290, still holding. Will likely bail if we break $300 again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** APP is a mobile tech company that helps devs market/monetize their apps through mobile advertising and marketing platforms, recently announced they were using AI.

**Risks:** The short report allegations are true and they essentially get banned from the Google App/Apple App Store.

**Related Tickers:** SNAP, PINS, TTD

**Ticker:** [**MRNA (Moderna)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract awarded to MRNA for bird flu vaccines.

**Technicals:** We saw a decent dip (roughly 5%) in MRNA afterhours yesterday, not too interested in this further unless we see further headlines about the contract being pulled completely.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** MRNA had massive growth during 2020 for being one of the main manufacturers of the COVID vaccine- right now bird flu is being touted as the next potential big pandemic to vaccinate against.

**Risks:** Cancellation is the the real catalyst after this news, or if the contract is awarded to a different company.

**Related Tickers:** PFE, NVAX

**Ticker:** [**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d)

**Catalyst:** SNOW beat expectations, EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.18 exp. and revenue of $986.8M vs. $957.6M exp.

The company also provided an optimistic outlook, projecting current-quarter product revenue between $955M-$960M, driven by increasing demand for AI-related products.

**Technicals:** Interested in $190 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SNOW is a cloud-based data warehousing company and benefits from the demand for AI/ML solutions.

AI is compute intensive which means they can charge more for their services. Also announced integration with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

**Risks:** SNOW doesn't generate GAAP profits still, data breaches, competitors, etc.

>He also announced that China, which already faces 10% U.S. tariffs on its imports, “will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date.”

**My take:** This news was released at  around 8:51 AM PT. I watched VXX, (VIX ETF),  BABA, FXI, SPY, plus other trade war participants that would be most affected. Interested mainly in triple levered ETFs like UPRO or YINN at the open to see if there's more volatility coming in (which there likely will be). This is somewhat of an incremental headline because we've seen Trump announce tariffs before but we never knew if they were a bluff or not, but today's tweet might be confirmation that this is actually happening (unless yet again, this is a bluff).

The trade for most of these catalysts is mainly just waiting with your hands on the keyboard and waiting for most of these tweets and being quick on the draw. I traded when Trump was president back in 2016-2020 and read close to every tweet he made.

stocks,Nvidia’s auto segment revenue surges to record high on demand for driver-assist tech,1izfnba,Puginator,2025-02-27 08:22:45,109,0.94,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izfnba/nvidias_auto_segment_revenue_surges_to_record/,"U.S. chipmaker Nvidia’s auto segment revenue more than doubled in the latest quarter to a record high on strong demand for driver-assist software.

While the company’s biggest revenue stream by far is chip systems that power artificial intelligence, Nvidia has predicted its products that power driver-assist technology could become its next “billion-dollar” business.

Revenue of Nvidia’s automotive and robotics segment rose 103% year on year to $570 million in the fourth quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. That brought the segment’s revenue for the fiscal year to $1.69 billion, above $1 billion for a second-straight year.

The latest increase in revenue was due to to sales of Nvidia’s “self-driving platforms,” according to the company’s CFO.

“This growth highlights Nvidia’s increasing exposure to powering ADAS, autonomous vehicles, and robotics through its DRIVE platform and related technologies,” Brady Wang, semiconductor analyst at Counterpoint Research, said in an email.

CEO Jensen Huang said in Nvidia’s earnings call the company expects that “every single one” of the 1 billion cars on the roads today “will be robotic cars” that collect data which Nvidia-supported AI systems can help refine, according to a FactSet transcript.

Automotive and robotics is “getting ready to take off,” likely due to investments in autonomous vehicles such as Waymo and Tesla, Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in an email. Munster also estimated that around 15 companies are building humanoid robots, potentially increasing demand for Nvidia chips.

“The performance of that segment is an important story below the fold that’s not getting much attention because it’s small,” he added, “but they can be a much bigger part of revenue going forward.”

Autos and robotics unit currently accounts for 1.45% of Nvidia’s total revenue.

Counterpoint’s Wang expects this growth to continue with Nvidia’s “increasing adoption of L2+ and more advanced systems”.

Several Chinese electric car companies, including BYD, Nio and Zeekr, use Nvidia’s driver-assist chip systems.

stocks,"WBD adds 6.4 million Max subscribers, forecasts 150 million subs by end of 2026",1izfe6e,Puginator,2025-02-27 08:10:55,40,0.91,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izfe6e/wbd_adds_64_million_max_subscribers_forecasts_150/,"Warner Bros. Discovery said Thursday it added 6.4 million global streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter for a total of 116.9 million subscribers.

Fourth-quarter revenue for the streaming segment, which is anchored by flagship service Max, totaled $2.65 billion, up 5% from $2.53 billion in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the unit came in at $409 million, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

In a shareholder letter, the company forecast adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion for its streaming business for the year — roughly double the $677 million adjusted EBITDA it reported for 2024 — and said it has a “clear path” to hit 150 million global subscribers by the end of 2026. Max is set to launch on television service Sky in the United Kingdom and Ireland by the second quarter of 2026, and will debut in Germany and Italy in the first quarter of that year.

The media and entertainment company announced Wednesday that Max would keep its B/R Sports and CNN content available at no additional cost to subscribers in its standard and premium tiers. Initially WBD planned to charge an additional cost for sports.

However, it will pull both verticals from its basic, ad-supported tier beginning March 30.

WBD’s overall fourth-quarter revenue fell 2% to $10.03 billion from $10.28 billion during the same quarter in 2023. Full-year 2024 revenue came in at $39.32 billion, down 5% from $41.32 billion in 2023.

Warner Bros. Discovery reported a net loss of $494 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, or a loss of 20 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $400 million, or a loss of 16 cents per share, during the fourth quarter of 2023.

TV networks revenue came in at $4.77 billion, compared to $5.04 billion in the year-earlier period. The company previously wrote down $9.1 billion for its networks business in its 2024 second-quarter earnings report. In its shareholder letter, Warner Bros. Discovery noted that it expects further declines in cable subscribers and that the advertising market for U.S. linear television is shrinking faster than expected.

For the studios business, fourth-quarter revenue totaled $3.66 billion, an increase of 15% from $3.17 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The stock price slipped 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.61 expected

Revenue: $9.99 billion vs. $10.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago in the quarter that ended Jan. 31, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.71 billion, or $1.75 per share, from $1.45 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.

The top category of subscription and support revenue was service, at $2.33 billion. The figure was up about 8% and below the $2.37 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. In the sales category, Salesforce generated $2.13 billion in revenue, up 8% and also trailing Visible Alpha’s consensus of $2.17 billion.

During the quarter, the company introduced its second-generation Agentforce artificial intelligence agent technology, which answers employee questions in the Slack team communications app.

Salesforce said it has completed more than 3,000 paid deals involving Agentforce since October. Agentforce has gotten involved in 380,000 conversations through Salesforce’s help website, with humans getting involved in 2% of cases, according to the statement.

“A lot of other vendors are talking about their agent capabilities, but few are able to show that they’ve got this really running at scale,” co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call with analysts.

Agentforce will make a modest contribution to revenue in fiscal 2026, with a larger effect in the following year, said Amy Weaver, Salesforce’s outgoing finance chief.

Benioff referred to a forthcoming product in the area of information technology service management, where ServiceNow operates.

The U.S. Department of Government Efficiency is using Slack, Benioff said.

“We’ll work closely with the government,” he said. “We’ll do anything we can to help them succeed.”

The company called for $2.53 to $2.55 in adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter, with $9.71 billion to $9.76 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated adjusted earnings of $2.61 per share, with $9.9 billion in revenue.

For fiscal 2026, Salesforce is targeting $11.09 to $11.17 in adjusted earnings per share on $40.5 billion to $40.9 billion in revenue, implying 7.4% growth. The LSEG consensus was for adjusted earnings per share of $11.18 on $41.35 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Salesforce shares are down about 8% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained about 1%.

Snowflake forecast annual 2026 product revenue growth of 24% to $4.28 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $4.21 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

A friend of mine said: “If the American people can suffer some short-term pain, the DJT will go down as the greatest President has ever had”.

To invoke a line from Speed: “Pop Quiz, Hot-Shot…When have you ever known the US population to be willing to take some short-term pain in the last 60 years?”

For me, I don’t think they’ve been willing to do that since World War II, and that’s saying something.

So when the Consumer Confidence Index — a key measurement of how people are feeling about their pockets (basically) — falls to 98.3 and down 7% since last month.

People are fearing a bloodbath. For their homes. For their wallets. For their futures.

“Of the five components of the Index, only consumers’ assessment of present business conditions improved, albeit slightly. Views of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high,” Stephanie Guichard, senior member of the Conference that issued the statement.

The labor market conditions wouldn’t be too bad if people were willing to get off their butts and replace all the undocumented workers who have been piled off back to their homes in the back of an armored truck and work in construction or farming, but people aren’t willing to do that.

Of course Johnny American is worried about future income. All companies seem to be doing is firing, firing, firing, firing and more firing, because they want to be please their beloved shareholders.

And the 401Ks — a way of almost guaranteeing their future happiness — are getting eroded while their credit card debts [are flying upwards](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc).

Simply telling people to throw in some beans and hope they’ll come out magic soon is quite simply a bad idea.

Food prices are expected to rise again in 2025, and the price of eggs — something that’s given a lot of headlines and used by the Democrats as a way of thumping Donnie but isn’t actually his or ANYONE’S fault — continues its exponential rise ($8-a-dozen, and you can’t kill off all the chickens in America).

One of the biggest employers in America — the construction industry (8 million workers — is on its knees at the moment. Among what is happening is that housing companies are blaming labour costs. That’s because of the difference between how many jobs have been lost thanks to Homeland Security, and how many visas have been produced. Combined with the fact that people are scared for their future, it’s a perfect storm.

The other reason is why people are scared — and you’ve guessed it — is AI. A [very recent poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2025/02/25/u-s-workers-are-more-worried-than-hopeful-about-future-ai-use-in-the-workplace/) by Pew Research said that 52% of US workers are scared crapless about computers taking their jobs. The techbros who try and tell you that there will be loads of jobs around the AI space are actually lying, it seems. 6% of the current workforce thinks that AI will create more job opportunities for them in the long-run, and 32% said that it will make for less. And the middle bit are lying to themselves.

And worse — the guys at the top have done absolutely nothing to reassure them. I’m sorry, but blasting out a few tweets isn’t going to help the American people in their immediate problems.

The current administration needs to work out how to get people happier about their current situations now, before it gets worse.

Prior to Wednesday’s move, the stock’s biggest one-day slump came in November, when it dropped 11%.

Instacart reported fourth-quarter revenue of $883 million, falling short of the $891 million average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. The company said it anticipates adjusted earnings of between $220 million and $230 million for the first quarter, below a consensus forecast of $237.1 million.

Gross transaction value, which measures the value of products sold, will come in between $9 billion and $9.15 billion in the quarter, compared to a FactSet estimate of $9 billion. Instacart said it expects average order growth to decline due to restaurant orders and its $0 delivery fee on minimum $10 baskets.

When Instacart held its Nasdaq debut in September 2023, it became the first notable venture-backed company to go public in the U.S. in about two years, as the market adjusted to soaring inflation and rising interest rates.

The company, whose official corporate name is Maplebear, closed its first day on the market with a roughly $11 billion market cap, down from its $39 billion private market valuation in 2021 during the Covid pandemic.

The stock peaked at $53.15 on Feb. 19, after rallying 76% last year. It closed on Wednesday at $42.80.

Eli Lilly plans at least $27 billion in new U.S. manufacturing investments",1iyta6k,_hiddenscout,2025-02-26 12:40:30,21,0.83,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iyta6k/health_and_science_eli_lilly_plans_at_least_27/,"Eli Lilly on Wednesday said it will invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing sites in the U.S., as demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes injections soars and the company develops new drugs for other conditions.

It comes as drugmakers and companies across different industries work to build goodwill with President Donald Trump, who has emphasized reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains. He has threatened companies — and pharmaceutical businesses in particular — with tariffs if they do not manufacture products in the U.S.

Eli Lilly made the announcement at an event in Washington, D.C. — emphasizing the political undertones of the strategy. The event featured several speakers from the Trump administration, including Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who explicitly tied the announcement to Trump’s policies.

Lutnick said the investment is “exactly what the Trump administration is all about, which is building and manufacturing and reshoring in America, investing in America, building in America.” He thanked Eli Lilly for “doing exactly what the president was hoping would happen.”

Lutnick added that “if you want to understand the tariff policy” of the U.S., “I have just articulated it.”

The move brings Eli Lilly’s total U.S. manufacturing investments to more than $50 billion in recent years. The other $23 billion is from the company’s investments in new plants and site expansions since 2020, which has helped ease supply shortages of its popular drugs.  

“This represents the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history,” Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at the event. “We’re making these investments ... to prepare for the demand we anticipate for future pipeline medicines across our therapeutic areas.”

Shares of the company rose more than 1% on Wednesday.

Three of the future U.S. sites announced Wednesday will manufacture active ingredients in medications, such as tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Ricks noted that there is a “real gap in supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to active ingredient availability in our country.”

The fourth site will extend the company’s global manufacturing network for future injectable therapies, he added.

Eli Lilly has not decided on where the four new U.S. sites will be located, Ricks said. The company will be accepting location submissions through March 13 and will announce decisions on new sites in the coming months.

Eli Lilly said the four new sites will create more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as engineers and scientists, along with 10,000 construction jobs as the plants are built. The company’s other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin.

The new investments aren’t solely dedicated to Eli Lilly’s current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions.

Ricks said the company is optimistic about its pipeline across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience.

Still, the new investments build on the success of Zepbound and Mounjaro, which share dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with Novo Nordisk’s weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. Some analysts expect the global obesity drug market to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s, making it critical for both companies to maintain their share as other drugmakers scramble to join.

During the event, Ricks took a shot at cheaper compounded versions of its injectable drugs, saying “America faces a growing threat from an influx of counterfeit and compounded medications.”

Eli Lilly’s efforts to boost the supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro aim to ensure that eligible patients are safely accessing those branded treatments instead of cheaper compounded versions. Patients flocked to those unapproved copycats when the branded drugs were in short supply, or if they didn’t have insurance coverage for the costly treatments. 

The FDA has since declared the shortage of tirzepatide over, which will essentially bar many compounding pharmacies from making copycats. 

Hassett said the issue also “disturbs the White House” because offshore producers of copycat drugs are “threatening lives in the U.S.”

stocks,Amazon unveils long-awaited Alexa revamped with AI features,1iyrlvl,Puginator,2025-02-26 11:31:48,57,0.84,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iyrlvl/amazon_unveils_longawaited_alexa_revamped_with_ai/,"Amazon on Wednesday announced a long-awaited overhaul of its Alexa digital assistant, and it will charge a monthly subscription fee to access it.

The revamped service, which Amazon is calling “Alexa+,” is powered by generative artificial intelligence, Panos Panay, the company’s senior vice president of devices and services, said on stage at an event in New York.

For the first time, Amazon will charge users to access the revamped Alexa+. The service will be $19.99 a month, or free for Amazon Prime members, and it will roll out next month.

Alexa+ will work on “almost every” Alexa device the company has shipped, Panay said.

“Every once in a while, a technology comes around and it changes everything,” Panay said. ”\[Large language models\] enter the stage and fundamentally change the way we think about AI...It’s shaken up everything.”

Alexa+ can purchase concert tickets, order groceries, book dinner reservations and give recipe suggestions tailored to specific people in a user’s household, among other tasks. It can also read study guides, then quiz users on the answers, as well as organize handwritten documents and recall information from them.

“She’ll learn the rhythm of your life and proactively take action with you,” Panay said.

Daniel Rausch, Amazon’s vice president of Alexa and Fire TV, said on stage that Alexa has undergone a “complete re-architecture” as part of the upgrade.

“It is not as easy as taking an LLM and jacking it into the original Alexa,” Rausch said.

Alexa+ uses a “broad range of state-of-the-art” training models from several providers, Rausch said. That includes Amazon’s own set of Nova models, as well as those created by third parties like Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic.

The company has faced growing pressure to upgrade Alexa since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, wowing users with its ability to perform complex functions like writing fiction and coding software. Suddenly Alexa and other voice assistants like it began to appear outdated, prompting Amazon to consider a revamp.

“They recognize they need to get this right and if they do get it right, then maybe we’re talking less about OpenAI vs. Anthropic and more of Alexa vs. ChatGPT,” said Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.

CNBC reported last May that Amazon was considering charging a monthly subscription fee for Alexa as part of a push to make money from the service.

An Alexa subscription fee could help Amazon offset the high cost of AI development, and make the digital assistant a more profitable business, said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager overseeing wearables and other devices at IDC.

“You look at any generative AI system out there, and they all have very high development costs,” Ubrani said.

Amazon will need to tread carefully with a paid Alexa service to avoid alienating Prime subscribers, who already pay $139 a year for the loyalty membership, Ubrani said.

The company will also have to show users “what this new Alexa can do” to justify a subscription, he added. OpenAI offers a free version of ChatGPT, as well as a premium subscription for $20 a month. A paid version of Anthropic’s Claude chatbot costs $20 a month.

“Their audience is already very large, so even transitioning a small portion of those users to a subscription could bring them a fair amount of money,” Ubrani said.

Launched in 2014, Alexa was a passion project of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who envisioned it could one day resemble an all-knowing computer like the one from “Star Trek.” Amazon established an early lead in voice software, and more than 500 million Alexa devices have been sold globally, the company said in 2023.

But Alexa hasn’t been as transformative as Bezos hoped. Most consumers use their digital assistants for “very simple tasks,” like checking the weather or playing music, and primarily via smartphones, not smart speakers, according to Forrester Research.

Alexa also remains unprofitable. Amazon has never charged for access to Alexa, instead infusing it into its lineup of smart speakers, tablets and other devices, which are notoriously priced at or below the cost to make them. The company hoped Alexa interactions would steer consumers toward spending money on its other products and services, but that failed to materialize.

Amazon has lost tens of billions of dollars on its devices business, which includes Echo, Kindle, Fire TV and other products, The Wall Street Journal reported last July.

Following the launch of ChatGPT, Amazon began working to overhaul Alexa with generative AI technology to make it more conversational and useful. The company demoed a souped-up Alexa in 2023, though that new version of Alexa, called “let’s chat,” didn’t launch to the public.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has closely scrutinized, or in some cases discontinued, several of the company’s more unproven or money-losing projects. That included the devices and services unit, which houses Alexa.

stocks,This sounds odd but I opened a long position in $TSCO because the store was so quiet....,1iyqqek,warrenfgerald,2025-02-26 10:55:58,67,0.83,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iyqqek/this_sounds_odd_but_i_opened_a_long_position_in/,"Normally when you walk into a farm supply store/Tractor Supply in the springtime you can hear the constant sound of dozens of baby chicks chirping away in metal brooders. Yesterday the store was silent. No chicks. They were all sold out. Apparently lots of people are concerned about egg prices. 

Now, baby chicks usually only cost around $5 each, but when you buy chicks for the first time, there is a ton of equipment you need to get the operation going. You need a heat lamp, dispensers for food/water, pine shavings, brooder (if you don't build your own), medicated chick feed, etc... TSCO sells all of this stuff.  They sell coops at TSCO which can sell for hundreds of dollars. The best part is that they also sell chicken feed so customers who buy chicks today will likely be regular customers for the next 5-7 years. 

The downside is that retail stocks often suffer during a recession, however its possible that farm supply stores could be recession proof if people try to save money by investing in their own property's food producing potential (think victory gardens during WWII), so a national economic downturn could result in more people buying seeds, fertilizer, farm tools, etc...",0,,2025-02-26,-0.3182,-0.4019,-0.5118282437324524,0.0,0.75,0.25,-0.33912499999999995,-0.3838711827993393,-0.3614980913996696,31.92509543001652,negative

As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA will accelerate delivery of needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

This contract follows successful testing on BlueWalker-3 in orbit under the previous contract announced in February 2024 and further demonstrates the unique capabilities of AST SpaceMobile's technology for specialized government applications. The company will utilize its next generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites, featuring the largest commercial phased array antennas ever deployed in low Earth orbit – spanning an unprecedented 2,400 square feet – setting a new standard for advanced connectivity and performance.

“This second contract supporting the SDA underscores the confidence in AST SpaceMobile’s innovative technology and its potential to support critical government missions,” said Chris Ivory, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Government Business of AST SpaceMobile. “We are deploying groundbreaking technology to create robust and resilient communications solutions and to enable new use cases for the U.S. government.""

AST SpaceMobile's technology, backed by 3,500 patent and patent-pending claims, offers unique dual-use advantages for both government and commercial customers. Its large, phased-array antennas and innovative architecture provides robust, resilient, and scalable solutions to address evolving mission needs.

stocks,So I took all this risk with SMCI for nothing?,1iyqfbq,ItsMango,2025-02-26 10:42:59,0,0.31,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iyqfbq/so_i_took_all_this_risk_with_smci_for_nothing/,"I'm new to this, and I want to better understand what's happening here. Is this yet another example of sell the news?

I bought SMCI week ago at $55 and was under an impression that 10-k would quickly propell share price to $65+. Days passed and market started to have doubts bottoming at $45 right before market has closed on deadline day and from my perspective I took extra $10 gamble per share.

10k was filed and price quickly shot up to $55+ pre-market which is good news except the fact that market opened below $55 and is still hovering around that price

I could have waited for them to file 10k, avoid all that uneccesary stress and risk and still came up with cheaper shares at the end of it. WTF? Didn't market climb all the way to $65 and then hover around $55-60 leading to 10k? What was the point of that gamble with all the risk and 0 upside?

I get it that market is forward looking but why was it pricing 10k at $55 before filing despite all that risk?

EDIT:

why $65? That's a random number I came up with when making this post and it's based on what stock traded at before 10k was filed. Point is I thought there is upside beyond $55 buy in and I mostly based that conviction on the idea that market makers wouldn't hold shares and risk smci being delisted if there wasn't any premium to make off of it

**NVDA earnings today, will likely decide the fate of the immediate market. It reports at 4:20 ET today!**

News: [China Plans To Start Bank Capital Hike With At Least 55 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/china-plans-to-start-bank-capital-hike-with-at-least-55-billion)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)/All Semiconductor Stocks/SMH

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Related Tickers:** INTC, QCOM, ASML

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

# [S&P 500 futures rebound from four-day losing streak, Nvidia gains before earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Wednesday following a fourth-straight day of losses for the S&P 500. Investors are also awaiting earnings from market bellwether Nvidia.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 93 points, or 0.2%. Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.7%, while S&P 500 futures climbed 0.4%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a weak session. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost nearly 1.4%. Both indexes logged their fourth consecutive losing day. The 30-stock Dow was the outlier, with a roughly 0.4% advance.
*****
> A weaker-than-expected consumer confidence reading from the Conference Board weighed on stocks Tuesday. A raft of recent reports, including disappointing retail sales numbers and a weak consumer sentiment reading have spurred traders’ worries around the economy over the past week — and the major averages have suffered.
*****
> Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings, due after the closing bell Wednesday, could be the next catalyst for the market. The stock climbed 2% in the premarket Wednesday.
*****
> The report arrives at a pivotal time for Nvidia. The emergence of DeepSeek raised questions about the sustainability of the once-hot artificial intelligence trade. The chip giant and other momentum plays are also showing signs of fizzling, with Nvidia down more than 5% in 2025.
*****
> “I think as the earnings report comes out tomorrow, my expectation is it’s going to be a lot like September,” NYU Stern School of Business finance professor Aswath Damodaran said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “A replay of [the] September [quarter] where they will beat analyst expectations, but the market is going to be disappointed because the market seems to have set expectations higher than what analysts are seeing for the company,” he added.
*****
> Economic data due on Wednesday include new home sales and building permits. The main event for investors will be the release of the personal consumption expenditures price index on Friday. The PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

stocks,Why I Went All-In on Tesla and maybe you should too – The Future is Here,1iyjv2c,Dvass138,2025-02-26 04:40:35,0,0.34,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iyjv2c/why_i_went_allin_on_tesla_and_maybe_you_should/,"I know a lot of people are out here chasing ""value stocks"" and ""strong fundamentals,"" but I’ve decided to take a different approach. After hours of deep research (watching a few YouTube videos and scrolling Twitter), I realized something: Tesla isn’t just a car company – it’s a movement.

First, let’s talk about Elon Musk. You might think he’s just a billionaire meme lord, but I see him as the closest thing to a modern-day prophet. Every time he tweets, markets move. That’s power. And if you don’t see the value in that, I don’t know what to tell you.

Second, the balance sheet? Who cares. Numbers are for accountants. Tesla doesn’t operate like a traditional business because it’s not a traditional business. It’s a tech company, an AI powerhouse, a battery innovator, a space exploration partner, and probably the future of teleportation if we’re being honest. Legacy automakers? They're still making cars. Tesla is building the infrastructure for a new civilization.

Then there’s the stock split phenomenon. Every time Tesla splits, it just… goes up. I don’t know why, I don’t need to know why. It just does. Some people say stock splits don’t create value—well, tell that to my brokerage account.

Let’s not forget Full Self-Driving. The haters love to point out that FSD isn’t fully autonomous yet. But real investors understand that it’s about the vision. It doesn’t matter if it’s ready this year, next year, or in 2045. The fact that it’s coming is enough. I don’t need my car to drive itself today—I need the stock to keep going up.

At the end of the day, it’s simple: Tesla is not just a stock. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a mindset. It’s a culture. And if you don’t see that, well, have fun with your little index funds.

See you on Mars. 🚀",0,,2025-02-26,0.0,0.9806,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.24515,0.0,0.122575,56.128750000000004,positive

stocks,Tesla’s market cap sinks below $1 trillion as stock slumps more than 8%,1iycoxa,Puginator,2025-02-25 21:14:55,2182,0.94,236,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iycoxa/teslas_market_cap_sinks_below_1_trillion_as_stock/,"Tesla’s postelection pop has almost disappeared.

Shares of the electric vehicle maker plunged more than 8% on Tuesday, pushing the company’s market cap below $1 trillion and to its lowest since Nov. 7, which was two days after President Donald Trump’s election victory.

The stock has plummeted 25% to start the year, while the Nasdaq is down just 1.5%, and has slid more than 35% from its record close on Dec. 16. CEO Elon Musk has lost more than $100 billion in net worth over that stretch, though he is still the world’s richest person, with a fortune valued at about $380 billion.

The latest slide followed a report from Reuters on Monday that Tesla’s long-awaited upgrade to its partially automated driving systems left owners disappointed. Many users told the publication that Tesla’s “navigate on city streets” feature in China fell short of Musk’s promises for self-driving technology.

Other EV makers in China, including BYD, offer their partially automated driving systems for free or a much lower cost. Xiaomi’s popular model SU7 includes the company’s equivalent technology as a standard option for free.

The report out of China added to anxiety among Tesla shareholders. Some of the concern has to do with the company’s performance and some is specific to Musk, who is spending much of his time in Washington, D.C., leading President Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Musk, along with his team in Washington, has gained unparalleled access to government computer systems and taxpayer data, and the president has enabled the billionaire to lead mass firings of workers in agencies tasked with oversight of his companies, including Tesla.

Musk’s extremist political rhetoric and activism has led opponents in various markets to organize protests, including at Tesla stores and service centers. Tesla’s stock dropped earlier this month on Trump’s announced plans for extensive tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which came alongside a decline in Tesla vehicle registrations across Europe in January and February.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla reported earnings and sales that missed analysts’ estimates, with automotive revenue dropping 8% from a year earlier and operating income plummeting 23%. In the late January report, the company cited reduced average selling prices across its aging lineup of Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X vehicles as a major reason for the decline.

According to the California New Car Dealers Association, Tesla sales dropped 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the state, which had been Tesla’s biggest market domestically.

Tesla shares are now about 20% above where they were trading prior to Trump’s victory. Most of what remains of the rally is due to the stock’s 15% jump the day after the election. Musk was a major backer of Trump’s presidential effort, contributing $290 million to Republican candidates and causes in 2024, with most of that directed at returning Trump to the White House.

Posted on this topic many many times before but many still don't seem to understand the game

Let me put it in layman's terms .... Wall st and big banking control the US stock market heck even the FED are in on it

NOTHING you are investing in fundamentally matters it is ALL A LIE 

They orchestrate the bear and bull markets in their entirety the drive extreme euphoria suck Dumb retail bulls into it and then dump the entire market to scare them into selling whilst shorting that side of the trade and buying back cheap

They've been doing this since the inception of it 

They do the reverse to bears although thats a bit different because they will just pump stocks that have high short interest to fry them and they know bears have shorter time frames to work with 

Robinhood and all the other ""free to trade"" brokers are selling your live trading data to Wall st and other Tutes this is then analysed by A.I and the trading algorithms are then sent to do what they do best 

If retail understood these very simple psychological games and just stopped trying to think they are the next Warren Buffets the markets would be much calmer and most would actually make a profit in the long run 

But that is the only way

Trying to trade against these rigged systems or trying to do a basic "" buy low sell high"" is asking to get fucked 

About 1 in 100,000,000 retail traders will understand this and thats why we will continue seeing chaos and volatility all year 

I'll be sitting on the sidelines with popcorn watching the chaos unfold

High-flying Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) stock tumbled down (almost) to Earth Tuesday after Bleecker Street Research -- which publishes ""public short ideas"" for its parent company, stock-shorting firm Bleecker Street Capital -- warned that Rocket Lab's highly anticipated Neutron medium-lift vehicle won't launch for ""a long, long time."" As of 1:15 p.m. ET, Rocket Lab stock is down 9%.

Why Bleecker Street hates Rocket Lab stock

Bleecker Street starts off its short report by naming the catalyst that's primarily responsible for Rocket Lab's 485% surge in stock market value over the last year. It says, ""\[I\]nvestor and analyst excitement over the upcoming launch of Neutron, a medium-lift rocket that RKLB hopes will compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9.""

Rocket Lab has been targeting a mid-2025 first launch for Neutron, with the analysts on [NextSpaceflight.com](http://NextSpaceflight.com) specifically penciling in a July target. But according to Bleecker, Rocket Lab ""has materially misled investors about the likelihood"" that its rocket will fly then.

However, Bleecker argues that Neutron isn't likely to take off before mid-2026 and may not fly before mid-2027. The short-seller supports its accusation by citing conversations with 23 unnamed ""rocket experts"" who have apparently told Bleecker that Rocket Lab's ""engine development,"" ""engine and structure production,"" ""launch pad construction,"" and ""rocket transport to the launch site"" infrastructure are all behind schedule, making a mid-2025 launch impossible.

Further bolstering the short-seller's argument, Bleecker says some of its ""experts"" are actually ""former Rocket Lab engineers and executives.",0,,2025-02-25,0.0,0.2732,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.0683,0.0,0.03415,51.707499999999996,neutral

Shares for the storage, server and networking provider closed the trade day down 11.5% as uncertainty swirled whether it would file its audited annual report for fiscal 2024 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 by the February 25 deadline. If not, it faced a possible delisting from Nasdaq.

""Due to EY's (Ernst and Young LLP) stated concerns and subsequent resignation, we were unable to timely file our Annual Report and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024 (together the 'Delinquent Reports') as required under Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5250,"" the filing reads. ""On December 6, 2024, Nasdaq granted us an exception to Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5250, allowing us to file all the Delinquent Reports by February 25, 2025.""

In Super Micro's 10-K filing, the company contends it does not agree with Ernst and Young's resignation or its reasons for doing so. Concerns about the company's financial statements cropped up in late August, when Hindenburg Research issued a report that it was short Super Micro's shares.

The EV maker sold just 9,900 units in Europe last month, a decline of more than 45 per cent from the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Its overall share of new car registrations fell to 1 per cent from 1.8 per cent over the same period.

Tesla’s falling market share comes after Musk’s unprecedented foray into EU politics, where he backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of the country’s elections, sparking a backlash on the continent. Musk has also railed against the EU, which he described in November as “undemocratic”.

The fall came even as European consumers purchased 166,000 battery EVs for the month, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Pure EV sales grew faster than those of all other types of vehicles, while sales of cars with petrol and diesel engines fell 20.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.

The figures include the EU, UK and other markets including Norway, one of Europe’s biggest markets for EVs.

European sales by SAIC Motor, the Chinese state-backed carmaker that has expanded into the EU and partnered with Audi in China, rose 37 per cent to 23,000 vehicles in January, among the largest year-on-year increases in sales of any large manufacturer in the region.

Overall new vehicle registrations on the continent fell by 2.1 per cent in January to 995,271.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been investing for a few months now and have built a solid foundation with ETFs, which I plan to invest in for the long term. However, since I still have three years of university ahead of me and don’t have a lot of money to invest yet, I want to use this time to experiment and learn more about individual stock investing.

I’m aware of how difficult it is to beat the market, but I also believe that if you don’t even try, you’ll never know. So, I spend time every day watching YouTube videos, analyzing stocks, and reading books. Some of the books I’ve already read include:
	•	One Up on Wall Street – Peter Lynch
	•	The Psychology of Money – Morgan Housel
	•	The Richest Man in Babylon – George S. Clason
	•	And a few lesser-known ones

I have a decent understanding of investing principles, but now I want to go deep into fundamental analysis—learning to properly evaluate every key financial metric: revenue, debt, cash flow, margins, growth rates, etc.

I’m looking for book recommendations that will help me truly master financial statement analysis and develop strong valuation skills. Any suggestions for must-read books on this topic?

Thanks in advance!

One of the most fascinating aspects of genome editing is its ability to potentially enhance not just human health but human capabilities. Take, for example, the controversial experiments in China where scientists edited genes in embryos to make babies resistant to certain diseases and possibly even smarter or fitter. These advancements spark ethical debates, but they also show the immense potential of genome editing to change the course of human evolution. If we can edit genes to fight diseases, enhance physical traits, and even improve intelligence, the possibilities seem endless.

But it’s not just about humans. Genome editing could also revolutionize agriculture. Imagine editing animals to grow more meat.

Looking ahead, the potential applications of genome editing expand even further. If humanity is serious about colonizing Mars, we’ll need people who can withstand the harsh conditions of space and the Red Planet. Genetic editing could play a role in enhancing human abilities to survive in those extreme environments, from boosting resistance to radiation to adapting to lower gravity.
Also super soldiers like Captain America would be used in defence.

News: [Trump Administration Seeks More Restrictions On China Tech Weighs Nvidia Curbs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/trump-administration-seeks-more-restrictions-on-china-tech-weighs-nvidia-curbs)

**Ticker:** [**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**NVDA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is planning to strengthen semiconductor export controls to China, aiming to strengthen the CHIPS act from Biden's term.

Additionally, DeepSeek is accelerating the release of its new AI model, R2, following the success of its R1 model. (Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)

**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.

**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.

**Related Tickers:** [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d), [QCOM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QCOM&p=d), [ASML](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)

**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (FTSE China 50 Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)

**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.

**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. 

**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.

**Related Tickers:** [JD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d), [BIDU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.

**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)

**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.

**Related Tickers:** [BA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d), [GD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d), [RTX](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.

Proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.

**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.

Security breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.

stocks,Bird Flu Could Be the Next Pandemic,1ixvxlc,spyapple,2025-02-25 09:13:45,0,0.33,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixvxlc/bird_flu_could_be_the_next_pandemic/,"Trump’s Final Year Echoes 2020-2021, Stocks Like Moderna & Arcturus Could Explode.

As we wrap up Trump’s final year in office, I can’t help but notice a pattern that mirrors the situation in 2020-2021 when COVID was being talked about as a possible pandemic. Now, with bird flu gaining traction in the headlines, we might be witnessing the next wave of pandemic fears building up again.

Here’s what I’m seeing:
Bird Flu Panic is Starting to Build.
Governments and media outlets are sounding the alarm on H5N1 bird flu, which has recently started spreading. This is leading to speculation that it could be the next global health crisis. The fears that people had about COVID-19 in early 2020 are resurfacing, and it seems like the panic might be building again—just like it did with the rise of COVID. If the situation escalates, the market could see a huge surge in stocks related to pandemic preparedness.

Stocks to Watch: Moderna & Arcturus
Moderna is already making waves with its mRNA technology. They’ve received massive funding to develop vaccines for H5N1, and just like with COVID, their stock could explode if bird flu turns into a global health emergency.
Arcturus Therapeutics is still early in their trials for an mRNA-based bird flu vaccine (H5N1). While they’re in Phase 1, the stock could skyrocket if the pandemic narrative continues to push forward and they get positive trial data. This is one of those high-risk, high-reward opportunities.

Pfizer’s at the Bottom Right Now.
Pfizer has been struggling recently and is at a low point in its stock price. While they were a leader in COVID vaccines, it seems like they’ve taken a hit with diminishing COVID vaccine demand now that the pandemic phase is over. This might be a buy the dip opportunity if bird flu takes off, but right now, they’re lagging behind the Moderna in bird flu vaccines developing

The market always seems to react in waves, and this could be a “buy the dip” scenario like we saw with COVID vaccine stocks in 2020. Moderna and Arcturus are looking like the stocks to watch closely. If the bird flu narrative keeps building momentum, don’t be surprised if these stocks see massive moves similar to what we saw in early 2020.

At the end of the day, whether you believe the hype or not, the market is reactionary, and if the bird flu narrative gets stronger, we could see some wild price swings.

Let me know what you think! Are you ready for another pandemic panic, or is this just another false alarm?

stocks,On Market Timing,1ixt56v,30030s,2025-02-25 06:48:08,57,0.61,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixt56v/on_market_timing/,"You cannot time the market, but there are times when it is due for a crash. At those times you definitely don’t want to buy on the dips, and you want to sell a bit more on the rips. Major market declines can happen really fast (think of the flash crash), but major declines like 2000 and 2008 give you notice that they’re coming. **Crashes occur when a majority of investors are just wrong about something big.** If you want to make money on stocks over the long run, it’s good to see the crashes coming. I’m pretty sure that one is coming now. I'm a successful investor with 30 years in equities. Let me review my experience in the dot com crash and the 2008 financial crisis.

I started investing significantly in 1996, when I got a better paying job. It was fun. You could identify new technologies and hold on for meteoric rise. I made a lot on IOM and AFFX. But it was clear that the market did not actually understand the internet. A company could double its market capitalization by getting a web site and renaming itself a dot com. Valuations reflected the mistaken idea that doing exactly the same business online was somehow going to be much more profitable. I remember realizing that I owned stocks that were worth far more than the underlying value of the company, but kept going up. I developed a rule (sell a third every time it triples) to get my money back while continuing to profit from the insanity. When things started to turn south, it didn’t take a genius to get out. When the bleeding stopped, I was early to get back in, looking for stocks that found support (low volume on down days) during the crash. Among the stocks I bought in 2001, I’ve done the best with AAPL.

The other big bear market I went through was 2008. Again, the fall can be traced to something that the majority of investors had wrong. I remember talking to a mortgage broker in 2004. They were pushing balloon mortgages and other nonsense that allowed people to buy houses they could not afford. I asked about the terms, and realized that shit would hit the fan in 2007 or 2008. It was not hard to see. There were a lot of these mortgages. As a homeowner, I got cold calls inviting me to refinance my 30 year fixed with something that would have a lower rate for a few years before exploding. Again, the economy was headed in the wrong direction because the market somehow thought these were safe. I can’t claim to have seen the crash coming (I thought the damage would be limited to foolish homeowners), but leveraged collateralized mortgage obligations set financial markets up for a fall. My point is that, once again, the market fell because the market was just wrong about something, and eventually reality could no longer be ignored.

We’re here again. A lot of people think Trump/DOGE will be good for business. Taxes will be cut and government waste eliminated. They do not understand how the parts of government being eliminated are good for business. I’ll give you three examples. First, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been eliminated, or at least crippled. The idea is that less regulation is a good thing. But without that protection, more consumers are going to be subject to scams, and the more sophisticated are not going to use services like X Money at all, because they are no longer safe. Second, there have been huge cuts to funding for science (NIH, USDA, NSF, etc.) with almost no attempt to identify what spending is actually wasteful. Innovation comes from science, so this will be very very bad for business over the long run. Third, DOGE cancelled legal contracts for government services with no warning. Even if you think that providing services to refugees is wasteful, it’s not fraudulent, and the American businesses who had those contracts were obviously hurt, as was trust in the government. 

Is it too late to avoid disaster? Maybe not, but I don’t see Donald Trump saying “oops” anytime soon.

So, we’re there again. The market will fall because the market is wrong about something big.

stocks,The Hidden Story of QuantumScape and Volkswagen: A Speculative Analysis from 2022 to 2025 and Beyond,1ixs5aj,pacha75,2025-02-25 05:42:51,5,0.6,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixs5aj/the_hidden_story_of_quantumscape_and_volkswagen_a/,"QuantumScape occupies a unique position as the only publicly traded solid-state battery EV technology company, requiring it to disclose far more information than its private competitors such as Factorial, ProLogium, and SES. While this visibility makes it a valuable source of information for investors, it has also become a strategic tool. The company has developed a pattern of delaying public confirmations of progress, often by one or two quarters, allowing it to control the narrative around its development.

Initially, this seemed to be a response to the investor lawsuits in 2022, which accused QuantumScape of misleading commercialisation timelines. By adopting a “prove first, announce later” approach, it reduced legal risks while keeping investors engaged. However, this delay serves another function: keeping competitors uncertain about its true progress.

Unlike private companies, which can operate in relative secrecy, QuantumScape must disclose financials, technology milestones, and partnerships through earnings calls, shareholder letters, and regulatory filings. This leaves it in a vulnerable position where competitors must rely on these disclosures to estimate its progress. By delaying key confirmations, QuantumScape ensures that its actual development is always ahead of what competitors perceive.

# How the Transcript-to-Letter Analysis Reveals QuantumScape’s Strategy

Over time, a clear pattern has emerged in the way QuantumScape discloses information. By comparing earnings call transcripts with future shareholder letters, it becomes possible to identify developments that were hinted at before being formally confirmed in later filings. This approach provides insight into how the company downplays milestones until they are fully validated, creating a built-in delay between when an event actually happens and when the market is informed.

The process works as follows:

1. **Identifying Forward-Looking Statements in Transcripts:**
   * During earnings calls, QuantumScape often mentions ongoing projects, goals for the coming year, and broad strategic plans. These statements are carefully worded to avoid firm commitments.
   * Phrases such as “we are making good progress,” “we are targeting,” or “we expect to begin validation” indicate that a milestone may have already been reached but has not yet been confirmed.
2. **Matching Statements to Later Shareholder Letters:**
   * Shareholder letters, published one or two quarters later, often contain more specific confirmations of previous statements.
   * If an earnings call in Q2 discusses a target and the shareholder letter in Q4 confirms that the milestone was achieved, it suggests that QuantumScape had likely reached that point well before announcing it.
3. **Recognising the Pattern of Delayed Confirmations:**
   * This approach has been observed multiple times, particularly in relation to prototype shipments, separator technology development, and PowerCo’s involvement.
   * For example, A0 samples were already validated internally in 2023, yet this was only publicly confirmed in early 2024.

This method of tracking delayed confirmations allows investors to anticipate upcoming announcements based on what has already been hinted at in earlier transcripts. It also reveals how far along QuantumScape actually is compared to its public disclosures.

# A Pattern of Delayed Confirmations and Hidden Progress: 2022 to 2025

# 2022: Lawsuits and the Beginning of Controlled Messaging

QuantumScape began 2022 with strong momentum but soon found itself facing lawsuits alleging that it had overstated its commercialisation timeline. This prompted a fundamental shift in communication, ensuring that no milestone would be announced until it was fully validated.

This meant that throughout 2022, earnings calls became more vague, with fewer forward-looking statements and a greater emphasis on measured language. Instead of predicting when milestones would be reached, QuantumScape began speaking in terms of progress without firm commitments.

# 2023: The Silent Acceleration Phase

By 2023, the company was progressing behind the scenes. It had already shipped A0 prototype samples to PowerCo, begun work on B0 samples, and expanded production capabilities, yet it continued to downplay its progress.

By comparing transcripts from early 2023 to shareholder letters in 2024, it becomes clear that A0 samples were internally validated in 2023 but only confirmed publicly in early 2024. This suggests that any major development QuantumScape hints at today is likely already further along than stated.

Meanwhile, Volkswagen was adjusting its broader EV strategy. Despite reducing its commitments in other areas, it continued investing in QuantumScape, indicating that it saw solid-state technology as an essential component of its long-term plans.

# 2024: PowerCo’s Deal and Volkswagen’s EV Strategy Shift

By mid-2024, PowerCo announced a non-exclusive licensing agreement with QuantumScape, committing significant funding to commercialise the company’s batteries. Given the pattern of delayed confirmations, it is reasonable to assume that this deal had already been finalised several months earlier and that PowerCo engineers were embedded within QuantumScape’s operations before the public confirmation.

Volkswagen’s decision to continue working with QuantumScape, despite scaling back some of its other battery investments, suggests that it sees QuantumScape’s technology as fundamental to its strategy.

# What May Already Be Happening but Has Not Yet Been Announced

Given QuantumScape’s habit of delaying public confirmations, it is possible to infer developments that are already in progress but have yet to be disclosed.

* **Cobra separator manufacturing equipment is likely already installed at PowerCo’s facilities.**
   * QuantumScape referenced next-generation separator equipment early in 2024 but only confirmed Cobra’s operational status in the fourth quarter. If this follows the company’s usual pattern, orders for Cobra may have been placed much earlier, and PowerCo may already be integrating it into its manufacturing process.
* **B1 sample production is likely already functional.**
   * QuantumScape listed B1 samples as a 2025 goal, but given that A0 and B0 were also downplayed before being confirmed, B1 samples are likely already working and undergoing internal testing at PowerCo.
* **At least one new OEM deal is probably already signed.**
   * In early 2025, QuantumScape said it was negotiating with two OEMs. Given its history of only announcing partnerships once deals are finalised, at least one of these agreements is likely already in place but undisclosed.
* **Mass production may begin in 2026 rather than 2027-2028.**
   * QuantumScape has been cautious about stating when production will begin, but if PowerCo is already integrating Cobra, the actual timeline may be earlier than publicly stated.

# The Market is Large, but First-Mover Advantage Matters

The solid-state battery industry is projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2035, covering EVs, grid storage, consumer electronics, and eVTOLs. There will be multiple successful players, and automakers are likely to work with several battery suppliers rather than relying on a single provider.

However, being the first to mass-produce solid-state batteries at scale is critically important. Unlike other technologies, automakers do not easily switch battery platforms due to the complexities of integration. Once a company establishes itself as a reliable supplier, it becomes difficult to displace.

QuantumScape does not need to eliminate competition. It only needs to be first to mass production, which would allow it to lock in early supply contracts, set industry standards, and establish itself as the reference technology for next-generation EVs.

By delaying confirmations, QuantumScape ensures that competitors remain behind, automakers feel pressured to commit early, and its manufacturing knowledge is protected. This is not simply a legal safeguard but a deliberate strategy to secure long-term leadership in a technology that has the potential to reshape the EV industry.

The real question is not what QuantumScape is saying today—it is what the company has already achieved that will not be disclosed until the next quarter.  Revenue is now within touching distance, and so is massive stock appreciation.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Now, SMCI faces a crucial deadline—it must submit its overdue 10-K and 10-Q filings by Feb 25 to avoid potential delisting. If they file on time, the stock will surge significantly, but short sellers are pushing a bearish narrative, betting on a missed deadline and Nasdaq removal. 

However, a lack of insider selling and institutional shorting suggests confidence in an on-time filing, making the current price potentially undervalued. If you already have a brokerage account and risk capital, SMCI may present a speculative opportunity ahead of the filing. That said, this can be seen as a high-risk, short-term bet, not a typical long-term investment. However, longer-term, SMCI remains a strong AI player, uniquely positioned to benefit from demand for custom-built AI servers, especially for Nvidia’s chips, while competitors like Dell and Lenovo lag behind. 



High Confidence for a Timely 10-K...

🚀 SMCI 10-K FILING: LESS THAN 24 HOURS TO GO 🚀

The probability of an on-time 10-K filing (Feb 25, 2025) is estimated at over 90% based on available data.


---

🔹 NO NOTICE OF LATE FILING

SMCI has historically provided 1-3 days’ notice when they were unable to file on time.

No notice has been given yet about a delay for the Feb 25, 2025, deadline, strongly suggesting they are on track.

📌 Key Insight: If SMCI were going to miss tomorrow’s deadline, we likely would have already heard by now.

🟢 BOTTOM LINE: No delay notice = strong confidence in an on-time filing.


---

🔹 KEY REASONS FOR CONFIDENCE

✅ INSTITUTIONAL CONFIDENCE

Large investors reviewed SMCI’s financials for the recent $700M convertible note offering.

Institutions require transparency before committing capital, indicating the 10-K is largely complete.


✅ NO MAJOR ACCOUNTING ISSUES

The latest 8-K filing flagged no major financial discrepancies, reducing concerns about serious accounting restatements.


✅ HISTORICAL PRECEDENT

Most companies in similar situations file on time to maintain credibility with investors and regulators.


✅ MORGAN STANLEY’S STRUCTURED INVESTMENT

Morgan Stanley issued market-linked securities (MLS) tied to SMCI’s stock, meaning institutional capital is betting on its future performance.

These securities offer contingent coupon payments of 31.25% annually, reinforcing that major financial institutions see upside potential in SMCI.



---

🔹 IMPACT OF THE MORGAN STANLEY STRUCTURED INVESTMENT

📌 What does this mean for SMCI investors?

Reinforces institutional confidence in SMCI.

Could influence price action, especially if short sellers try to manipulate volatility.

Signals that major financial players see an opportunity in SMCI despite recent concerns.



---

🔹 WHAT TO EXPECT TOMORROW

⏳ TIMING:

The 10-K will likely be filed after-hours, around 4:30–5:00 PM EST.


📉 PRICE ACTION:

If the stock dips intraday, it may be due to weak hands selling in fear.

Once the filing is confirmed, upside potential is high.

Morgan Stanley’s structured investment may exacerbate volatility as institutions hedge their positions, amplifying swings both up and down.


📈 LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:

SMCI remains fundamentally strong.

Once the uncertainty of the delayed 10-K is removed, the stock has room to climb significantly.



---

🔹 MINOR RISKS TO CONSIDER

⚠️ REGULATORY SCRUTINY

The SEC & DOJ investigations (linked to Hindenburg allegations) exist.

However, no fraud or major restatements have been indicated.


⚠️ MARKET VOLATILITY

Stock price fluctuations may continue, but they do not affect the likelihood of the filing itself.



---

🔹 FINAL THOUGHT

We are very close to the finish line.

If SMCI delivers on time, expect:
✅ Relief buying
✅ Short covering
✅ Strong momentum

If the stock drops further before the filing, it may present a buying opportunity for those with conviction.

Stay focused—tomorrow could be a major turning point. 🚀

The cuts will not affect workers at the company’s cafes.

In a message to corporate employees, Niccol said Starbucks is “simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams.”

“Our intent is to operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration,” Niccol wrote. “All with the goal of being more focused and able to drive greater impact on our priorities.” 

The layoffs come as Starbucks tries to draw coffee drinkers back to its cafes after same-store sales declined for four straight quarters. As customers turn to cheaper rivals in Starbucks’ two largest markets, the U.S. and China, Niccol has tried to revamp operations since he took the helm of the company last year, including by speeding up service.

Starbucks had about 16,000 employees who work outside of store locations as of last year. The cuts will affect people who work in corporate support, but not roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution.

stocks,Hims & Hers shares tumble 18% as margin miss adds to concerns about GLP-1 business,1ixeabc,Puginator,2025-02-24 16:58:55,225,0.98,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixeabc/hims_hers_shares_tumble_18_as_margin_miss_adds_to/,"Hims & Hers Health shares plunged 18% in extended trading on Monday after investors looked past better-than-expected revenue and earnings and focused instead on the disappointing gross margin.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** 11 cents vs. 10 cents expected by LSEG
* **Revenue:** $481 million vs. $470 million expected by LSEG

Revenue at the telehealth company increased 95% in the fourth quarter from $246.6 million during the same period last year, according to a release.

However, the company’s gross margin, or the profit left after accounting for the cost of goods sold, was 77%, while analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting 78.4%.

It’s the second big stock drop for Hims & Hers in a matter of days. The shares tumbled 26% on Friday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the shortage of semaglutide injection products has been resolved.

In May, Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster GLP-1 medications Ozempic and Wegovy. The company was a breakout star within the digital health sector in 2024, in part because of the success of its popular new weight loss offering. The stock climbed about 200% for the year.

Compounded drugs are custom-made alternatives to brand-name drugs designed to meet a specific patient’s needs, and compounders are allowed to produce them when brand-name treatments are in shortage. The FDA said Friday that it will start taking action against compounders for violations in the next 60 to 90 days.

Hims & Hers also offers treatments for skin care, mental health, sexual health and hair care.

Excluding its GLP-1 offerings, revenue increased 43% to $1.2 billion for the full year, “meeting our previous 2025 revenue target a year early,” CFO Yemi Okupe said in a release.

“The success we are experiencing is a direct reflection of our improving ability to democratize access to high quality, personalized care across each of our specialties,” Okupe said.

Net income climbed to $26.01 million, or 11 cents per share, from $1.25 million, or 1 cent per share, a year prior. The company reported adjusted earnings of $54.1 million, meeting analyst estimates, according to StreetAccount.

Anyway, I vaguely remember the stock market crash of 1987.  I was young but I used to play a stock trading game on my “IBM Compatible” computer which really wasn’t but that is how they sold you computers back then.  It had a ticker that would scroll across the screen and you could buy and sell stocks in made up companies.

No one really knows where the stock market is heading the rest of the year but I could make a pretty good argument we are moving towards stagflation temporarily.  I can see a scenario of a weakening economy with persistent inflation.  So, if the market were to move negative the rest of the year, what are your picks to see the largest downside moves?

My picks:

TSLA - Obvious reasons…its stock prices is built on a dream that is becoming a nightmare
PINS - Low revenue growth outside the U.S, ADU growth slowing down, It is mostly ads now and almost unusable. 25B market came to 3.5B revenue.
SNAP - 11 years in and still can’t make a profit.  

Also, if federal grant money really does decline, and cuts to Medicaid, pick any public health care stock and buy puts.  If they cancel infrastructure contracts, pick most of the shovel companies like Caterpillar and buy puts.  If they cancel the farmer subsidies, buy puts in John Deere.  So many others that are going to be hurt.

So what is your pick for the largest declining stock of 2025 between 2/25 and 12/31?  ",1,TSLA,2025-02-24,0.8236,0.4555,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.7315750000000001,0.0,0.36578750000000004,68.289375,positive

Specifically related to US Export controls impacting Applied Materials re:China. Keep in mind, I'm hearing increased rhetoric lately on Trump having a surprisingly pro-China agenda (could be wrong - LMK if so).

**Idea Genesis**: US Senator, Ashley Moody bought $300-$750k in Applied Materials ($AMAT) stock. Though I know she was only recently appointed in Jan 2025. She sits on these following relevant committees: 

(less interestingly) **Senate Committee on the Judiciary**: oversees the Department of Justice, considers judicial nominations, and reviews legislation related to civil liberties, **intellectual property**, and antitrust law.

(more interestingly) **Joint Economic Committee (JEC)**: reviewing economic conditions and recommending improvements in economic policy. It studies the implications of the Economic Report of the President and coordinates programs involved in the report.

Committees like the JEC, plays a vital role in setting the legislative framework for **export controls.** They can:

1. 1. Pass laws that authorize and guide export control policies. 
2. Conduct oversight of the executive branch's implementation of these policies. 
3. Examine the economic impact of export controls.  

The JEC specifically focuses on analyzing economic conditions and recommending economic policies. So, they would be involved in analyzing the economic effects of export bans, such as:

**Takeaway1:** Any thoughts on the US changing export control bans to China? Impacting companies like Applied Materials?

**Takeaway2:** Any other notable points regarding Applied Materials on go forward tailwinds/headwinds?

Their fundamentals look rosy given the current share price ($172; -32% vs. July 2024 peak).

What It Means for the AI Trade.",1ix27vd,_hiddenscout,2025-02-24 08:38:10,201,0.93,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ix27vd/microsoft_cancels_some_data_center_leases_td/,"Microsoft has begun to scale back on data center spending, according to an analysts’ note, but Wall Street is divided on whether this suggests a change to the company’s artificial-intelligence strategy.

TD Cowen analysts first reported in a research note Friday that Microsoft had cancelled leases with “at least two data private center operators” in the U.S., amounting to a few hundred megawatts.

Shares of Microsoft were flat in premarket trading Monday.

The analysts said the tech behemoth also has pulled back on the conversion of statements of qualification to leases and had re-allocated a considerable portion of its international spending to the U.S., pointing to a potential oversupply.

However, Jefferies analysts said in a note Monday that Microsoft executives were “strongly refuting” any change to their data center strategy.

The company is “always tweaking their forecasting of how tight certain regions will be and where investment needs to be prioritized,” the analysts continued.

They noted that the company had guided to capital expenditure growth slowing year over year, “so down from the 50% to 60% YoY pace, but still growing.”

It is “still too early” to say if the changes in data center capacity are a reflection of softer-than-expected AI demand or oversupply, the analysts wrote. In their view, the changes could be driven by power constraints or better-than-expected data-center efficiency.

“Zooming out, reminder that we are still very much in the early innings of this AI buildout, and not everything will be linear or in a straight line,” the analysts continued. “What is increasingly clear is that the market’s faith in the whole AI capex narrative is wobbling.”

Edit: 
The response here kind of proves the point.  Bulls here have always had the DCA mindset, which is all good,  but if you're not hedged for big corrections don't pretend like you're a genius investor. How many of you are simply sitting on mag7 below current cost and riding on that hope?

I'd like to note, it's alarming how many of you think insane tarrifs will not have an affect on the market, it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the current supply chain. 

The fact consumer sentiment is down 10% isn't insignificant. 

2% corrections across the broader markets are not nothing.

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

In Q4 2024, they hit a milestone with revenue topping $1.15 billion, an 18% jump year-over-year, making it their first billion-dollar quarter. For the full year, they racked up $3.65 billion in revenue, up 19% from 2023. Their user base is growing too—global monthly active users (MAUs) reached an all-time high of 553 million, up 11% from last year. On the profit front, Q3 2024 showed a GAAP net income of $31 million, with an adjusted EBITDA of $242 million, proving they’re not just growing but also sharpening their focus on profitability. Total costs and expenses for Q3 were $904 million, showing they’re keeping things in check while scaling.

Pinterest stands out as a unique social media platform with a focus on inspiration and discovery, driving high-intent users—think DIY enthusiasts, shoppers, and planners—straight to actionable ideas. Its revenue has been climbing steadily,fuelled by smart ad innovations like shoppable pins and a growing user base of over 500 million monthly active users. Unlike fleeting platforms, Pinterest users stick around, curating boards with long-term value, which keeps engagement sticky and ad potential strong. Plus, it’s carving a niche in e-commerce, partnering with brands to tap into a $2 trillion addressable market. With its stock still seen as undervalued by some analysts and a clear path to profitability, Pinterest could be a sleeper hit for patient investors.

Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here’s a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he “expects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].” In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect “25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.”

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that “DLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months” -- it’s not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro’s 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell “will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.”

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell’s NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a “particularly strong” Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv’s strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell’s AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the “unpredictability of the AI shipments” as there are “some more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.”

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: “Now of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory” and also that it is “higher than what we actually saw in 2024.”

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were “on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.”

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn’t check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia’s Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products “are driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.”

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 – which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. “Now, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that’s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.”

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell’s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that “We know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.”

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: “Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.”

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that “net sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.”

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations – it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly “disrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,” by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell’s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it’s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it’s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors – the timing of Blackwell’s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia’s stock marches higher – perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",1,NVDA,2025-02-23,0.0,0.9979,-0.7725628614425659,0.7947134375572205,0.75,0.25,0.249475,-0.3807437866926193,-0.06563439334630966,46.718280332684515,neutral

Unabashed momentum investor/trader back with a 1-week update.  My intent was to just update twice a month, beginning and middle, but one of my picks came off with its 10% trailing stop, so I needed to pick another.  

The kickoff post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1is447t/my_momentum_stock_picks_1st_installment_midfeb/).  

A little branding change in the title:  my initials are M.D., and in the Navy I was given the nickname Mad Dawg.  Not Mad Dog, but Mad D*aw*g, according to the guy who gave it to me.  

I thought that would be fun, and maybe help my posts not get lost in the sea of posts here.  But don't let the crazy name fool you:  I scored highest in my graduating class on the ACT (Midwest, similar to the SAT), got a Mechanical Engineering degree from University of Illinois while being married and having a baby (I don't recommend that), nuclear Engineering Officer in the Navy, federally-licensed Senior Reactor Operator at a nuclear power plant, and now I work for the federal agency that issues those licenses to people.  

And I love the markets and numbers and calculations and probabilities.  And I have OCD, so I don't let things go easily.  And I don't watch TV or carouse around, so I have a lot of time to dig into things.  And at 61 I've been around the investing block a few times and have tried just about everything there is to try.  

And having observed several data points in my investing career that momentum trading works, I've decided to 'prove' it over at least a year.  Hence these posts.  

**Rules:**  
Pick charts that look good over a year or so.  
Put a 10% trailing stop on and let them run as long as they will.  
When one comes off, replace it.  

My original picks, with their 1-week performances (last week was short due to the Monday holiday):  

**FOX** 52.35 to 53.01, *up 1.2%* in 4 days  
**HOOD** 63.31 to 51.60.  Stopped out at 56.97.  **-10%**  
**HWM** 136.25 to 129.83, **-4.7%**  
**IBKR** 236.00 to 218.73, **-7.3%**  
**WMT** 103.72 to 94.78, **-8.6%**  

And just so you know, I didn't cheat with the Trailing Stops by just looking at daily closing prices.  Because a true TS will follow intraday highs and put the Stop Loss 10% below that, dynamically.  

So for instance, Walmart had an intraday high of 104.20 on Wednesday, and taking 10% from gives 93.78.  It got as low at 94.12 on Friday, but wouldn't have been stopped out.  

And tell me, how does a company *beat* earnings expectations and *go down 7%??*  That's Walmart.    
And Robinhood too, except it dropped enough to get stopped out.  

**So new rule:**  
No new picks with only x weeks to Earnings.  

What should 'x' be?  
I don't know, 6 or 7 weeks, so you catch it in between earnings?  
11 weeks, so earnings were 2 weeks ago?  
2 weeks??  
Put your thoughts below.  
**I'm going to use 4 weeks for now:**  
*New picks can't have earnings coming up within 4 weeks.*  
That allows for hopefully 4w of riding the trend up before getting clobbered by missing *or hitting* earnings.  

**New pick:  
SAP** 287.40 [Monday 2/24 opening price]    

How did I choose it?  On Barchart I have a watchlist of ""Top stocks by market cap (over 25Bn).""  362 stocks, all at least $25 Billion market cap.  
I sorted that by ""52W %Chg,"" then started flipping through the ""flipcharts,"" with a 1-year view.  

Until Walmart's earnings-beat-but-went-*down* debacle last week, it was my benchmark, with 1y & 5y charts that looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/walmart-1y-5y-gHcW2K8).  

So that's the kind of chart I was looking for in this new screen.  

**SAP** looks like [this on the 1-year](https://imgur.com/a/O3adPr8).  
That's a pretty chart, isn't it?  And its next earnings date is April 22nd, more than 4 weeks out.

Uncertainty in  
**1. tariff** : They need to have a clear visibility of how much tariff will be applied to which goods coming from where.  
That's the only way, they can plan where and how to shift manufacturing. Without some visibility, even the current goods production carries risk. Does the tariff apply by the time the goods are produced ? the only way to cover the risk is to run minimal production and charge extra to cover the risks. This translates to inflation.  
If they are placing order overseas, like for summer clothing with a Chinese firm, the Chinese firm will ask more as they have to cover for the risk of tariff ( the same risk if they place an order with a US manufacturing, that has some parts supplied from China).  
**2. worker :** The deportation of undocumented workers hasn't kicked on full gear. It's awaiting budget allocation of money. The deportation will cause mass movement of undocumented workers, putting significant pressure on some industries ( restaurant, farms , home builders, home rentals). These industries,  constraint on workers, will have to pay more and raise their prices on goods produced.  
**3. federal worker layoff:** lot of industries depend on either government approval ( pharma, energy, nuclear energy) or government projects ( defense , cloud companies government regions). The current layoffs will cause all these to freeze up in the short run.  
**4. competing tech from China** : Chinese companies are getting more competitive in EV, AI and robotics. Also countries frustrated with US tariffs be more open to China and Chinese tech.  
**5. rising inflation** : the inflation numbers are rising back up in a very troubling sign. The Jan CPI was 0.5. By comparison last year Jan 2024 CPI was 0.3. That's a 0.2 increase. And these are no signs of this trend changing immediately.

The only 2 positive upcoming changes are tax cuts  ( the business tax is only 21%, so it won't be as good as 2017 tax cut, but money repatriation could create one-time large dividend) and crypto laws.

Looks like it's time to keep a more guarded outlook, be more in cash and wait next few months till we get final clarity on the tariff and inflation front and wait for market to adjust to it.

stocks,Oversold? Why I am Buying / DCA-ing the Dip On Monday,1ivwrt6,designbeast1,2025-02-22 18:57:46,0,0.47,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ivwrt6/oversold_why_i_am_buying_dcaing_the_dip_on_monday/,"A lot of Friday sell off was an amalgamation of many things, but here's why I think it's oversold and that that a bounce is coming. Many forgot that the monthly expiration was Friday for the options market. Max pain was around 601 for SPY (where most contracts expire worthless). Market makers dumped most of their hedge by selling their stocks as max pain was hit on monthly expiration and a ton of calls expired so they don't need to deliver the stocks owed (which I bet they will bid back on Monday). Also a lot of puts were bought so they needed to short the market even more in order to hedge (there's a lot of put interest right now; almost a 3:1 ratio). All of this compounded and caused a massive 100 point drop in the market.

Sure the Tariff narrative is sold to us create to ton of bearish sentiment, but as you guys saw, if he says one thing about pausing tariffs, striking a deal, or pausing their unemployment plan, then the market will bounce to higher highs, and those that sold at bottom are going to end up having to buy at the top.

Plan: Overall, I am gonna stick to my plan of not trying to time the bottom, and continue to buy each dip. A lot of stocks like CFLT, UPST, APP, and even HOOD are back to near pre-earning levels even after a successful earnings beat. So as long as NVIDIA doesn't completely s\*\*\* the bed and if Jpowell doesn't decide to hike rates during FOMC, then I am DCAing and buying the dip at open. Buy (slowly) when most others are fearful.

EDIT: I see a lot of people thinking that this is potentially the start of a bear market and I just want to say:  
Sure we may get a healthy correction sooner or later, but as for a bear market... ""Since 1945, there have been 15 bear markets—one about every 5.1 years. The bull market that ended in 2020 to be the longest on record""... This might not even anywhere close to the top. The last bear market ended in October 2022. Bear markets don't happen often and unless there's another black swan event like covid or the unemployment rate hits 6-8%, then the market will continue to melt up.

EDIT 2: bought the dip in monday and some calls for stocks mentioned above. Trump back to talking deals with EU and France. Market is also bouncing.

stocks,MELI: The $114B Tech Giant You Probably Haven't Discussed Enough,1ivv6ti,TheiaFintech,2025-02-22 17:41:51,120,0.85,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ivv6ti/meli_the_114b_tech_giant_you_probably_havent/,"Been diving into stocks outside the US lately, and I stumbled upon MercadoLibre (MELI). I know it's been around for a while, but searching this sub, I was surprised to see how little it's discussed here. Figured I'd share my thoughts and hear what others think.

**Quick Overview:**  
MercadoLibre is basically Latin America's Amazon + PayPal combined. They run the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America and have a massive fintech operation (Mercado Pago) that's becoming a beast of its own.

**Key Stats:**

* Market Cap: $114B
* Revenue: $18.4B (TTM), up from $7B in 2021
* Profit Margin: 9%
* Free Cash Flow: $6.18B (TTM), up from $356M in 2021
* EPS Growth: 92% (TTM)
* ROE: 51%
* Forward P/E: 51 (PEG ratio: 1.37)
* Balance Sheet: More cash than debt
* Expected Revenue Growth: \~25% (analyst consensus)

**What Caught My Eye:**

1. Their financials are solid and getting better - that FCF growth is insane
2. They're profitable while still growing rapidly
3. The valuation looks high at first (51 P/E), but with their growth rate, the PEG ratio of 1.37 doesn't seem crazy

**The ""But What About"" Part:**  
Yeah, there are the usual emerging market concerns - political instability, currency risks, regulatory uncertainty, etc. But honestly, looking at the past few years, even US companies aren't immune to these issues anymore.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How do you view emerging market risks in today's global economy? Are we overplaying these risks for companies like MELI?
2. The Latin American e-commerce market is way less saturated than the US - how much runway for growth is left?
3. Their fintech division is killing it in a region where many people are still unbanked. Could this be their biggest growth driver?
4. With their market cap over $100B, are they still flying under the radar of US investors?

I feel like we spend so much time discussing the same US tech stocks, we might be missing some interesting opportunities elsewhere. MELI seems to have the scale, growth, and fundamentals that we usually get excited about.

The numbers turned out great on that report - they had beat EPS by over 20% (beat revenue by a hair) and reaffirmed the strong guidance given in the previous quarter. Disney+ has now been profitable for 3 quarters in a row after bleeding money. Parks and cruises are doing great - this quarter even had hurricanes shuttering business and still did had beats across the board

Trading after the call surged up 5% to $118 and some change, then had a brutal reversal midday; it now finds itself at $108 and some change and is just dripping downwards every day

I’m a little confused on this one - since the report, it’s done nothing but receive upgrades, upwards price target revisions (JP Morgan, GS, Morgan Stanley, and a bunch of others all in $130-140 range now), and upwards earnings revisions. And it’s done nothing but go down. 

The only thing I have seen is that Disney+ lost subscribers - but it was forecast, and beat anyways. They had hiked prices and the forecast was to lose 1.5M subscribers and came in at losing half that. Plus, Disney+ is just one of their streaming services - they actually gained overall because Hulu came in strong. Not to mention streaming is one component in Disney’s earnings

I also saw that Cramer has been pounding the table on the stock. Maybe that’s the reason (joking)

(VIGAX, VTI, VIG, SCHD, SCHY, BNDI, JAAA, JBBB, SGOV)

My logic is that my portfolio is not only at an all-time high (+37% since Jan 1 2024), but somehow added 8.5% since the start of the year (figs do not include fresh investment). That seems a bit wild, honestly; it speaks to me of exuberance. And in terms of financial planning, I am already where I would modestly project to be in autumn 2026. So that made me inclined to hedge a bit and lock in that tip-top portfolio value best I can.

Then add in the macro-economic issues that are starting to bubble up: inflation is sticky, consumer sentiment is icky (both of those in the USA and globally), in everyday life everybody is talking inflation again, I'm reading articles about people prepping for tough economic times, DOGE is putting metric shit-tons of people in the unemployment line, government services are going to work with less efficiency, tariffs are still coming, and Trump is a chaos agent. Who know what he cooks up next?

Donald Trump clearly doesn't have a plan what he is going to do. He just likes to be the King of the USA. On the other hand, Elon Musk, more widely representing firstly himself and secondly the tech bros is totally different that the ""previous elite"" which has put more focus on diplomacy, ensuring stable and peaceful global order. The tech bros don't give a f about that, their interest is to maximize the development of the digital world and bringing humanity into space and their power. 

While the tech bros are clueless about the history and geopolitics in the past,. Russia and China must be happy. Instead of Russia and China being in the shadows of the USA like in the past I assume tech bros are willing to give them open hands to do whatever they want if they just cooperate with them with the tech visions.

  
This would mean that economically (for China) the risks for China doing something stupid is not as severe as before and the countries surrounding China and whole Europe on the other hand are less attractive due to their weakened security position. I still don't believe investors would trust their money on the CCP.

I am sure Europe will get their act together when they realize the tech bros are not helping them because their interest are in deregulation of Europe by supporting the right wing parties of France, UK and Germany who in exchange would serve the tech bros. This will however not happen, due to people in UK and Germany being on average highly educated compared to  average population in the red states. 

  
China and Russia will of course want to destroy the USA dominance and rules based global order if they are given the chance because it has been blocking their imperialistic visions.  Tech bros and Trump are giving them a chance.

Currently my 40% portfolio is $PK, but I’m thinking of going like 90%. Dividends are 10%+, and in their recent call, the CEO showed interest in closing the gap to fair value by doing buybacks of stocks.

Does anyone else have any good insight in this? I’m aware of recession-related risks that damage hotel REITs, or the major loan for a Hawaii hotel ($1.4B) to be repaid by Park Hotels in late 2026. But with how they beautifully handled COVID19 and with a bunch of available resources, I think of worst case scenarios (like defaulting on the $1.4B loan or recession) & they’re probably gonna remain fine even if they occur.

Summary stats: 

* Revenues of $1,730 million , surpassing expectations of $1,400 million

* Achieved Q4 2024 gross profit of $170 million, first gross profit in company history

* Q4 Adjusted EBITDA improved +$729 million YoY (-$277 million Q4 '24 compared to -$1,006 million Q4 '23)

* Q4 operating expenses decreased 15% YoY

* For the full year, Rivian posted a $4.75 billion loss, with revenue of $4.97 billion, reflecting a 12% increase.

2025 guidance expects a ""modest gross profit.""

* 46,000 - 51,000 expected deliveries 

* Expected Adj. EBITDA between -$1,700 million to -$1,900 million

* Expects to expand capital expenditures to $1,600 million - $1,700 million as it prepares to launch its new ""R2"" vehicle in first-half 2026.

And while not the biggest headline stat, one of the more shocking numbers of the report to me was their claim that the material costs of the R2 will be *half* of the R1:

> Our focus on cost efficiency across the business is critical for the launch of our mass market product, R2. The R2 bill of materials is approximately 95% sourced and is expected to be approximately half that of the improved R1 bill of materials.

1-He states that it is price valuation has ballooned way too quickly and is a bubble. So there will be a massive correction.



2-He states that they only really do graphics cards and software and with such a narrow market focus it makes no sense why they are the world's second most valuable company.



3-He states that ai technology is overhyped and it has reached the top of its s-curve.



4-He states that would be hard to improve the hardware without a breakthrough from quantum computing which will take quite a few years.



5-He states that most modern gamers now prefer older games and indie games.



6-He states that most modern gamers only care about good graphics to a point and the artstyle/design is what truly makes a game look good.



7 -He states the CEO (Jenson Huang) is pretentious and disconnected from reality.



So what should I respond to him with or do you think he is right. Just asking for some honest advice.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sat at an interview where he outlined the company’s plan for artificial intelligence, surprising some in the space in an hour-long session with Dwarkesh Patel. Nadella talked about how AI's impact should be measured, the exponential growth for compute demand, its practical applications, and how it will affect humans — and Microsoft’s recent quantum breakthrough. However, one of the biggest revelations in the interview was his approach to building more hardware for AI.

Nadella says that Microsoft will still need to build compute that can “actually help me not only train the next big model but also serve the next big model.” However, he also said that “there will be an overbuild” and that “it’s not just companies deploying, countries are going to deploy capital”. The Microsoft CEO said that even though he builds a lot, he also plans to lease a lot of compute. “I am thrilled that I’m going to be leasing a lot of capacity in ’27, ’28,” Nadella said. “Because I look at the builds, and I’m saying, ‘This is fantastic.’ The only thing that’s going to happen with all the compute build is the prices are going to come down.”

He likened this mindset of putting up more compute on the supply side argument of “Hey, let me build it and they’ll come.” However, he pointed out that supply and demand must have some equilibrium, and that he’s tracking both sides of the equation. He said that you have to have proof that initial investments in AI hardware would translate into demand, ensuring that you can reinvest your capital.

# Backing off of AGI

Nadella also said that general intelligence milestones aren’t the real indicators of how AI has come along. “Us self-claiming some AGI milestone, that’s just nonsensical benchmark hacking to me.” Instead, he compared AI to the invention of the steam engine during the Industrial Revolution. “The winners are going to be the broader industry that uses this commodity (AI) that, by the way, is abundant. Suddenly productivity goes up and the economy is growing at a faster rate,” said the CEO. He then added later, “The real benchmark is the world growing at 10%.”

The Microsoft CEO did not explicitly say that his company will stop building AI data centers, especially as the company has just signed a contract to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant for its data centers. However, it seems that he’s already put a cap on their capital expenditure, especially as competitors are also putting up their own infrastructure. Instead, Microsoft might lease capacity from them.

Aside from all this, Nadella also showed off Microsoft’s breakthrough quantum chip, which he calls a “transistor moment” in quantum computing. The greatest advancement here is that the development could potentially make it feasible to build a quantum computer with millions of qubits, allowing the company to build a “utility-scale quantum computer.” Nadella even claimed that they’ll actually be able to build this in about four years’ time.

Q4 2024 Performance: Net sales were $18.6 billion, slightly down from $18.9 billion in Q4 2023. Net earnings stood at $527 million ($2.22 per share), impacted by $1.7 billion in losses from classified programs. ​

Stock Reaction: Following the earnings release, LMT's stock experienced a 9.2% decline, influenced by the dip in net sales and a conservative profit outlook for 2025. ​

Political and Industry Context:

Defense Budget Considerations: The current administration is evaluating defense budget adjustments, with discussions about potential cuts to reallocate funds toward border security and drone programs. While initial reports suggested significant reductions, officials have indicated a more modest $50 billion reallocation. ​

Competitive Landscape: Traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin are facing increased competition from tech firms entering the defense sector. Companies such as Palantir and SpaceX are bringing innovative approaches, potentially reshaping the industry's dynamics. 

Financial Outlook: Given the recent earnings and potential budget reallocations, how do you foresee Lockheed Martin's financial performance evolving in the near term?​

Market Position: With tech companies making inroads into defense, what strategies should Lockheed Martin adopt to maintain its competitive edge?​

Investment Perspective: Considering the current political and economic landscape, do you view LMT as a buy, hold, or sell?",0,,2025-02-21,0.0,0.9592,0.0,-0.9704186916351318,0.75,0.25,0.2398,-0.24260467290878296,-0.001402336454391473,49.92988317728042,neutral

The Justice Department has launched an investigation into UnitedHealth Group’s UNH Medicare billing practices in recent months, people familiar with the matter say.

The new civil fraud investigation is examining the company’s practices for recording diagnoses that trigger extra payments to its Medicare Advantage plans, including at physician groups the insurance giant owns. 

A series of articles in The Wall Street Journal last year showed that Medicare paid UnitedHealth billions of dollars for questionable diagnoses. Attorneys with the Justice Department as recently as Jan. 31 interviewed medical providers named in the articles.

In the Medicare Advantage system, insurers get lump-sum payments from the federal government to oversee enrollees’ Medicare benefits. When patients have certain diagnoses, the payments go up, creating an incentive to diagnose more diseases. 

The Medicare billing investigation adds to the scrutiny on UnitedHealth, the $400 billion company that owns the largest U.S. health insurer and a sprawling network of other health-industry assets including its doctor practices, a large pharmacy-benefit manager and data and technology operations.

The civil investigation, some of the people said, is separate from a longer-running Justice Department antitrust probe that the Journal reported last February. The DOJ also has sued to block UnitedHealth’s $3.3 billion planned acquisition of home-health company  Amedisys on antitrust grounds

A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, which is also involved in the civil fraud probe, declined to comment. 

UnitedHealth declined to comment. UnitedHealth previously has said its practices lead to more accurate diagnoses, that it performs well in Medicare audits and that its approach benefits patients.

In December, the Journal reported that its analysis of billions of Medicare records showed that patients examined by UnitedHealth-employed doctors had huge increases in lucrative diagnoses after joining the company’s Medicare Advantage plans.

Doctors said UnitedHealth, based in the Minneapolis area, trained them to document revenue-generating diagnoses, including some they felt were obscure or irrelevant. The company also used software to suggest conditions and paid bonuses for considering the suggestions, among other tactics, according to the doctors.

Last summer, the Journal also reported that UnitedHealth added diagnoses to patients’ records for conditions that no doctor treated, which triggered an extra $8.7 billion in federal payments in 2021. The untreated diagnoses stemmed from sources including in-home visits by nurses working for the company’s HouseCalls unit. Each visit by the UnitedHealth-employed nurses was worth an average of $2,735 in additional federal payments a Journal analysis of Medicare data spanning 2019 to 2021 found. 

Last month, Justice Department lawyers from the offices of the U.S. Attorney for Minnesota and the Washington, D.C.-based Civil Division contacted at least three doctors and a nurse practitioner who were named in the Journal’s story on UnitedHealth-owned clinics. One of the people was told the health department’s Office of Inspector General was involved as well.

Three said they were questioned about specific diagnoses UnitedHealth promoted for employees to use with patients, incentive arrangements and pressure to add the diagnoses. At least two provided documents, including a contract with a UnitedHealth unit, to the Justice Department. 

Valerie O’Meara, a nurse practitioner who worked for UnitedHealth in Washington state, said she was interviewed on Jan. 31 by Justice Department attorneys who were interested in the company software that suggested diagnoses and the role of a UnitedHealth manager who she said urged her to make new diagnoses beyond what doctors had treated. 

The attorneys zeroed in on certain diagnoses the company often suggested, such as an obscure hormonal condition called secondary hyperaldosteronism, she said. The Journal’s analysis found the condition was rarely diagnosed by Medicare doctors not working for UnitedHealth.

O’Meara said the attorneys focused on her account of how she was told she could add the hyperaldosteronism diagnosis to patients’ records without a lab test. 

More broadly, she said, “they were looking at, ‘Is this abuse?’ ” 

UnitedHealth has said its practices help detect diseases earlier, saving money for the health system. The company says Medicare Advantage plans generate better health outcomes and reduce costs.

In a press release published on its website on Dec. 30, UnitedHealth said the Journal’s articles “rely on often incomplete and inaccurate data to conduct flawed studies through a murky government ‘agreement’.” 

The Journal’s analyses used data UnitedHealth and other Medicare Advantage insurers themselves submitted to the federal government for payment purposes. Reporters accessed the data under a standard research agreement with the agency overseeing Medicare. 

UnitedHealth has faced investigations of its diagnosis-documenting practices before, and its Medicare payments have been examined in health department inspector general reports. The Justice Department took over an earlier lawsuit by a former UnitedHealth employee alleging the company failed to retract inaccurate diagnoses added to patients’ records. 

UnitedHealth has disputed the allegations against it in that continuing case.",0,,2025-02-21,0.0,0.9944,0.0,-0.5367274880409241,0.75,0.25,0.2486,-0.13418187201023102,0.057209063994884485,52.86045319974423,neutral

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

stocks,Valuation On $Unity post earnings with FCF model,1iufdlt,shakenbake6874,2025-02-20 20:49:42,18,0.9,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iufdlt/valuation_on_unity_post_earnings_with_fcf_model/,"Based on the latest earnings call from Unity and looking at their potential for FCF growth I see a lot of upside potential. With using a conservative discount rate and execution risk premium I arrive at around $59 a share or $47 if you like a 20% safety factor. Today they showed 60% yoy FCF growth. So basically the main assumption is if they grow they hit that next year and then start to taper that growth rate down over 10 years to terminal growth of 6% this is the intrinsic value of the stock. 

I'm looking for feedback on this model. Let me know what you think of the assumptions and growth rate projections. Let me know if you think I'm crazy or it sucks or whatever! Thanks in advance!

stocks,Amazon surpasses Walmart in revenue for the first time,1iudefo,Puginator,2025-02-20 19:01:06,773,0.96,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iudefo/amazon_surpasses_walmart_in_revenue_for_the_first/,"Amazon has dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever.

Amazon said earlier this month that it brought in $187.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter. That beat Walmart’s sales for the period, which came in at $180.5 billion, the company reported on Thursday.

Since 2012, Walmart has held the distinction of being the top revenue generator each quarter, a title it gained after overtaking oil giant Exxon Mobil.

Walmart still leads the way in annual sales, though Amazon is gaining ground. Walmart is projected to reel in $708.7 billion in the fiscal year ahead while Amazon’s full-year revenue for 2025 is expected to reach $700.8 billion, according to FactSet.

Amazon’s core retail unit remains its biggest revenue generator, but its top line is also being fueled by its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses. Third-party seller services, which includes commissions and fees collected by Amazon on fulfillment and shipping, advertising and customer support, accounted for 24.5% of the company’s total sales last year. Amazon Web Services was responsible for nearly 17%.

Walmart has looked to its chief rival for ways to sustain sales growth. The company operates a third-party marketplace and offers sellers fulfillment services, although both businesses are a fraction of the size of Amazon’s. Walmart has also launched an advertising business and a loyalty program for shoppers, called Walmart+, that competes with Amazon Prime.

stocks,Could this be an insane little risk investing strategy over the long run? I’m new to these direction daily ETF’s,1iubyeu,Davis_Cook07,2025-02-20 17:55:32,0,0.29,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iubyeu/could_this_be_an_insane_little_risk_investing/,"
Basically there are these new ETF's called direction daily that try to multiply a stocks earnings and losses. For example, there is the direxion daily S&P500 bull 3x(SPXL) that pretty much 3x's the s&p 500 gains/losses. This last year the S&P went up 22%, this 3x direction daily stock went up 59%, which comes out to 2.68 times the S&P 500's gains.

If people view the S&P as a safe bet in the long term that consistently produces 9-10% returns on investment, could I just put my money into these 3x etf's and make anywhere from 20-30% year over year? Where's the risk involved in the long run? I just don't know too much about how these ETF's work and if there are other cons to investing in them. Perhaps somebody here would know more? Or would know another reddit be page that would know more?

Because if this stuff is legit this thing could be the best wealth creation tool ever to exist. Every investor dreams of having year over year returns like Warren buffets 23% anual compounding rate.

And because they do not sell cars in the US, they have 0 exposure in the American market so they are immune from Trump's tariffs.

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

I no longer have the time to dedicate to keeping up with trading and shifting my positions around based on data and research. I'd like to just ""cash out"" this account by selling all my shares and moving the money to a Roth IRA or taxable account where I can just buy some index funds and sit on them.



If I sell and make realized gains of \~$700 (mix of short- and long-term gains and I am in the 22% bracket, so let's say 20% cap gains tax rate overall), will I pay around $140 in taxes? Is this inevitable or since I have a relatively small portfolio are there any exceptions or contingencies I could take to keep more of the money?

*****
> Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 110 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% each.
*****
> Dow member Walmart dropped more than 7% after the company said it expects fiscal year sales to grow between 3% and 4%. The company’s fiscal 2026 earnings outlook, meanwhile, was also below analyst expectations. The weak guidance overshadowed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the S&P 500 on Wednesday posting another record high. The Nasdaq Composite and the 30-stock Dow also finished in positive territory as investors shrugged off President Donald Trump’s warning of more tariffs.

In the first quarters of the pandemic, office owners steeply discounted prime office space and leased it to tenants, who normally have a second-generation budget.

stocks,'Stagflation' fears haunt US markets despite Trump's pro-growth agenda,1ituftv,confused_boner,2025-02-20 04:14:05,393,0.9,109,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ituftv/stagflation_fears_haunt_us_markets_despite_trumps/,"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/stagflation-fears-haunt-us-markets-despite-trumps-pro-growth-agenda-2025-02-20/

Feb 20 (Reuters) - Stubborn inflation and President Donald Trump's hard-line trade policies have rekindled fears of stagflation, a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation that haunted the U.S. in the 1970s, even as markets remain upbeat on his pro-growth agenda.

The potential return of stagflation, which would pressure a range of assets, has been flagged periodically over the past 50 years but not materialized as a real threat to investor portfolios. While economists and portfolio managers are not ready to say that this time is different, the dreaded scenario has crept back as a key risk for investors in recent weeks, as the prospect of trade wars and punitive tariffs cast a shadow over U.S. growth.

""Stagflation has definitely re-emerged as a possibility because we have these policies that could hurt consumer demand even while persistent inflation limits the Federal Reserve's ability to maneuver,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for Brandywine Global's fixed income strategies. ""It's not a zero-possibility scenario any more, by a long shot.""

A key piece of the stagflation puzzle - inflation that refuses to cool down - lodged more firmly into place earlier this month, when government data showed consumer prices rose in January at their fastest monthly pace since August 2023, bringing the annual rate of inflation to 3%.

The other piece of the puzzle, U.S. economic growth, hangs in the balance, with Trump's tariffs threatening to add inflationary pressure that could tip the scale.

""What continues to concern us more than the risk of inflation is stagflation,"" said Tim Urbanowicz, chief investment strategist at Innovator Capital Management. ""There is that sticky base of inflation to contend with but on top of that, tariffs have the potential to slow down the economy by becoming a tax on consumers and weighing on profits and economic growth.""

A Bank of America survey of global fund managers on Tuesday showed the proportion of investors expecting stagflation - defined by the bank as below-trend growth and above-trend inflation - over the next year stood at a seven-month high. At the same time, investors remained bullish on stocks, with a trade war seen as a low-probability risk, the survey showed.

While Trump postponed imposing new tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico for a month at the beginning of February, he has rolled out a new 10% levy on all Chinese imports and announced tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports.

He has also tasked his economics team with devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports, and this week said he plans to introduce 25% tariffs on autos, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports.

Some investors believe any hit to growth from tariffs would be temporary.
Over a longer-term horizon, tariffs could even promote growth, said Maddi Dessner, head of asset class services at Capital Group, boosting industries that will benefit from less competition globally. On the other hand, their initial impact could increase price pressures.

""The truth is it's probably going to be somewhere in between those two things,"" she said, adding tariffs were partly why Capital Group now forecasts 10-year Treasury yields at 3.9% over a 20-year horizon, up from a 3.7% forecast last year.

'NOT THERE YET'

Stagflation emerged as a source of anxiety as recently as 2022, when inflation rates spiked and stock and bond prices plummeted, but that scenario did not materialize as inflation eventually eased and growth remained resilient.
Many believe that the U.S. economy will once again steer clear of stagflation.
So-called core inflation at about 3% remains well below the levels hit in the 1970s, when the annual rate of core inflation averaged about 7%. This time around inflation expectations remain ""anchored"", meaning the long-term inflation picture is not fluctuating wildly with each fresh piece of economic data, said Evercore ISI in a recent note.

Still, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned the market may be underestimating stagflation risks. The prospect of large-scale deportations of workers without visas or other work documents, another Trump campaign pledge, also would fuel inflation, he noted.
""Tariffs and deportations are a recipe for inflation and hurt growth; both are negative supply shocks,"" he said, adding that negative supply shocks such as a crude oil price surge contributed to 1970s stagflation.

Guneet Dhingra, head of US rates strategy at BNP Paribas, said the market has been ""complacent"" over the past six months, focusing on Trump's pro-growth policies. He said stagflation-wary investors could sell two-year Treasuries, likely to lose value due to higher inflation, and buy 10-year Treasuries that would benefit in a low-growth scenario.

Surging interest in gold , which hit another all-time high on Wednesday, suggests some investors are worried, as gold is one of a handful of assets that hold their value in a stagflationary environment, said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors.

The other big winner would be cash, said Brandywine's McIntyre, but he added that for now he was holding back from making big shifts to cash-like fixed income instruments.

""I'm not there yet,"" McIntyre said.

I don't want to put everything into only a few companies, so the list is long, but that also makes it crazy to research them all in time before any future gains.

The American subsidary of BAE Systems contributes almost half of the company's global revenues, so I ruled out buying it. I'm now wondering what other companies to replace with something else due to the original one being too dependent on US happenings. I'm also only buying stocks denominated in non-USD currencies.

Obviously these numbers seem pretty bad on their own without context. My guess is that the market is valuing more like a tech-growth stock, and if we've learned anything from Carvana... sometimes the story and momentum are most important things.

Now, I know the real estate market is objectively terrible and probably isn't getting better in the near term, but this might be the exception in the short-term because it has been vastly outperforming the sector and the market. There is a lot to like here. Note: My focus in this is mainly as a swing trade, I don't typically hold long term.

**Take a look at the highlights from today's earnings report (via yahoo)** 

**Revenue:** $1.38 billion in Q4, a 25.9% increase year-over-year.

Their financials are trending in the right direction, especially given the pressure the real estate market has been under lately.

So the regard in me came to the conclusion that they are essentially a combination of an Uber and Zillow: that specializing in selling house to the super rich.

*What I mean by that:*

* **The way they are using their technology is potentially disruptive like Uber.** They aren't just a marketplace like Zillow which makes money selling leads; they're a whole ass cloud-based real estate brokerage.
* **Their work force pays them** to use their platform which has a proprietary CRM system, automated marketing tools, analytics, and uses AI to help them determine the price, etc. Agents make commissions.
* **They also do a shit ton of acquisitions (24 so far).** This is strategic positioning to gain market share when mortgage rates finally come down.
* **Keep in mind** that a significant portion of their business and marketing image is tailored to ***the ultra rich***\*.\* From what I could find, 35% of their 22,000 active listing are listed under Private Exclusive. They also recruit luxury real estate agents for this specific purpose.

**I also just got to looking at the dark pool data from today and my interpretation was this:**

**Dark Pool Data:**  
**Net Vol. :** \-3,504,876  
**Net Vol$ :** \-35,889,930  
**Position :** \-13,369,776  
**Position$:** \-110,410,00

Given the massive volume from today's trading sessions ([6X@29.37m](mailto:6X@29.37m)), huge net-short volume that aligns with the price action, and sharp decrease in the rolling 20-day short volume: this appears to be a genuine breakout instead of a temporary pump.

**25%** of the short float was liquidated or covered today with almost no pullbacks at 6 times the normal volume. This means buyers were driving the price action,

The way it melted up, adding $1.5B to its cap makes me think that the market is positioning for a move to $12-$13 dollars per share, with $10 is the new base.

Overall dark pool position is still negative, so that's always a short exposure risk, but I'm biting and going all in tomorrow.

**Bonus:**

***Options are stupid cheap for it.***  
**IV Rank:** 11.45

I just inherited 100k from my grandfather and I have no idea how to invest it responsibly right now.  The market seems unstable, but inflation seems close and WTF is going on right now in Washington? 
I know this is a novice question… but I am a novice. 

For Context; I am 30, I own a small country house and another small property, hold about 20k in gold and silver but I have zero stocks, bonds or any traditional investment portfolio of any type. My finances are decent, I make about 70k a year and I don’t live big. I have a 4 month emergency fund, own my vehicles and don’t have any other debt aside from my mortgage. I just graduated college with my Bachelors (two actually) and I have some decent job prospects on the horizon. 

Ironically before inheriting this money I opened a Roth IRA to begin investing in more traditional methods rather than just buying precious metals. 

I considered just buying a some general ETFs, maybe 20k in the Dow, 30k in the S&P 500 and 20k in the NASDAQ?  Also considered buying some Swiss CHF because seems to be a very consistent currency and as well as a small amount of Chinese Yuen for speculation. 

These are just spitball ideas, I’m not familiar with these products. 

Any advice would be really helpful.



Also, I’m 100% happy to just buy a kilo of gold and call it a day.

Thanks!

stocks,"Palantir plunges after CEO Karp changes share sales plan, Pentagon budget cut report",1itncot,Puginator,2025-02-19 21:05:37,918,0.96,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1itncot/palantir_plunges_after_ceo_karp_changes_share/,"The share price of Palantir fell as much as 12.5% Wednesday after news that CEO Alex Karp had adopted a new stock trading plan, and a report that the Pentagon has been ordered to prepare to cut the U.S. defense budget by 8% each year for the next five years.

Palantir is best known for its contracting work providing software and technology services for defense agencies.

On Tuesday night, Palantir in a regulatory filing disclosed that Karp’s new plan will allow him to sell nearly 10 million shares of company stock in the next six months.

The Washington Post on Wednesday said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered senior Pentagon leaders and other military brass to develop plans to slash the defense budget over the next half decade. The budget for the current fiscal year is around $850 billion.

The Post reported that Hegseth ordered the proposed cuts to be drawn up by Monday.

Palantir closed trading Wednesday at $112.06 per share, a drop of 10%. Shares were down more than 1.5% in after-hours trading.

The company, whose market capitalization tops $255 billion, in early February reported $828 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, with adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share.

Before Wednesday’s abrupt drop, Palantir had been one of the top-performing stocks in the U.S. for the last two years, including a share price rise of nearly 50% in the year to date.

Palantir trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 600-to-1.

The Trump administration has been engaged in a wide-ranging effort to slash government spending and the number of federal government workers since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second nonconsecutive term on Jan. 20.

Trump appointed Tesla CEO Elon Musk to oversee that effort, dubbed the “Department of Government Efficiency.”

Musk and Trump have come under fire for their methods in achieving DOGE’s goal, with some steps being challenged successfully in federal court.

On Tuesday, Karp, who co-founded the company with Peter Thiel, defended Musk during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

“What the progressive left should be doing is saying, ‘OK, Elon, you’re clearly the most qualified person in the world to do something like this. We want a dialog with you about what you’re doing, how you’re doing,’” Karp said.

“I don’t believe that’s happened,” he added.

This, paired with their trend of falling on earnings regardless of surprises like during their previous two earnings, is gonna happen again and make the stock dip a few %.

Things to keep in mind :

1. Nvidia is gonna have to address the deepseek impacts, what could they possibly say to deter the fears that AI is getting more efficient to compute? It's not a question of chip performance, it's a question of being able to do the same or more, on less. Deepseek, while clearly did not cost 5.6mln to develop, still came out to have a pricetag that was significantly cheaper than OpenAI's development cost of 20bln (between 1-2bln, and this was on older Nvidia hardware). It's going to get increasingly more difficult to justify their exorbitant prices for their GPUs and chips, margins are gonna shrink.

2. Mag7 Capex investments mean multiple companies are going to be coming up with their own chips, while Nvidia still hold the performance lead on theirs, others like AMD could catch up in the future. Furthermore, Microsofts newest quantum chip just knocked the expectations of commercially deploying quantum computing from a couple of decades to a couple of years. While they don't have the production ready yet, they have all the infrastructure online and ready. Nvidia's monopoly is coming to an end faster than we're expecting.

3. Nvidia historically tends to fall on earnings, their previous 2 reports all led to a noticeable drop in share price, even though they were beating their main metrics by a long shot. 

What do you guys think is gonna happen post-earnings to Nvidia? I'm setting a pre-earnings target of about 145$. Eager to hear what you guys think. ",0,,2025-02-19,0.0,0.901,0.0,-0.4125807285308838,0.75,0.25,0.22525,-0.10314518213272095,0.06105240893363953,53.05262044668198,neutral

But with their new CEO being Elliott Hill, someone who started at the company over 25 years ago as an intern and quite literally worked his way to the top(look at his LinkedIn, he climbed from position to position in Nike), idk why but to me its promising. This is someone who worked in so many different positions and departments in Nike, who kept getting promotions, to me that shows he knows his shit, is good at it, works hard at it.

Let's take a look at the ""rigorously"" reviewed Nature paper. I have rigorously in quotation marks because the process is far from it. As we will see, Nature forced the paper through while 2/4 referees did not support publication.

The paper is at [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08445-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08445-2) . You can scroll to the bottom to access the referee reports. First of all. You will see that one of the referees voluntarily revealed his name, Hao Zhang. This is the same guy that was found to have manipulated data in a [previous Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03373-x), and this paper was retracted after independent analysis found that they shifted the data manually to make the values consistent with a quantized value. So right off the bat, the Nature editor is already not doing a proper job of soliciting referees.

Now let's read the [actual referee report](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-08445-2/MediaObjects/41586_2024_8445_MOESM2_ESM.pdf). There are 4 referees, which is more than usual, presumably because it is a high profile work. At the very top, the editorial team has the following comments: 

# The editorial team wishes to point out that the results in this manuscript do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes in the reported devices. The work is published for introducing a device  architecture that might enable fusion experiments using future Majorana zero modes.

essentially, Majorana modes are the critical piece of physics required for topological quantum computing, and microsoft DID NOT demonstrate that.

In the first round, 3 of the 4 referees declined to provide strong recommendation for publication:

Ref 1: *In summary, I have no great criticisms of the experiment and the data (which by themselves constitute a good piece of the state of the art of single-shot parity measurements in a hybrid device and their dependence on flux), but rather in the rather misleading way in which these data are presented and the extreme simplifications of the modeling which, essentially asumes a topological state and includes Majoranas by hand, yet again forcing an a priori interpretation of the data.*

Ref 2: *As stated above, the relationship to Majorana physics is not completely certain and needs some serious scrutiny.*

Ref 4: *The authors claim their work is a significant step toward the realization of topological qubits. To my view, however, the reported achievements do not meet Nature’s novelty and relevance standards. Moreover, the conclusions drawn in this work rest on questionable hypothesis and methodologies. As a result, I cannot recommend publication in Nature.*

Now, if you are familiar with publishing in the top journals Nature and Science (and I have published in and been rejected from them), you would know that three do-not-recommends and 1 neutral is automatic rejection. Most of the time, even 2/3 do-not-recommends is a full rejection.

Now the editor gave the authors a chance to respond, which is again already unusual but it's a big team so let's give them the benefit of the doubt.

The authors' reply in round 2 DID NOT convince all the referees and address their concerns. Still 2 firm do-not-recommends:

Ref 1: *Given my overall impression and comments above, I cannot recommend the paper for publication in Nature.*

Ref 4: *Due to the above reasons, I am firmly convinced this work should not be published in Nature or any other high visibility journal.*

Microsoft on Wednesday announced Majorana 1, its first quantum computing chip. 

The achievement comes after the company has spent nearly two decades of research in the field. 

Technologists believe quantum computers could one day efficiently solve problems that would be taxing if not impossible for classical computers. Today’s computers use bits that can be either on or off while quantum computers employ quantum bits, or qubits, that can operate in both states simultaneously.

Google and IBM have also developed quantum processors, as have smaller companies IonQ and Rigetti Computing. Microsoft’s quantum chip employs eight topological qubits using indium arsenide, which is a semiconductor, and aluminum, which is a superconductor. A new paper in the journal Nature describes the chip in detail.

Microsoft won’t be allowing clients to use its Majorana 1 chip through the company’s Azure public cloud, as it plans to do with its custom artificial intelligence chip, Maia 100. Instead, Majorana 1 is a step toward a goal of a million qubits on a chip, following extensive physics research.

Rather than rely on Taiwan Semiconductor or another company for fabrication, Microsoft is manufacturing the components of Majorana 1 itself in the U.S. That’s possible because the work is unfolding at a small scale.

“We want to get to a few hundred qubits before we start talking about commercial reliability,” Jason Zander, a Microsoft executive vice president, told CNBC.

In the meantime, the company will engage with national laboratories and universities on research using Majorana 1. 

Despite the focus on research, investors are fascinated by quantum.

IonQ shares went up 237% in 2024, and Rigetti gained nearly 1,500%. The two generated a combined $14.8 million in third-quarter revenue. Further gains came in January, after Microsoft issued a blog post declaring that 2025 is “the year to become quantum-ready.”

Microsoft’s Azure Quantum cloud service, which lets developers experiment with programs and algorithms, offers access to chips from IonQ and Rigetti. It’s possible that a Microsoft quantum chip might become available through Azure before 2030, Zander said.

“There’s a lot of speculation that we’re decades off from this,” he said. “We believe it’s more like years.”

Rather than exist as a stand-alone category, quantum computing might end up boosting other parts of Microsoft. For example, there’s Microsoft’s AI business, which has an annualized revenue run rate that exceeds $13 billion. Quantum computers could be used to build data used to train AI models, Zander said. 

“Now you can ask it to invent some new molecule, invent some new drug, something that really would have been impossible to do before,” Zander said.",0,,2025-02-19,0.0,0.9628,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.2407,0.0,0.12035,56.0175,positive

I see so many posts about how the stock market is going to crash because of Trump, or because some other global event. 

And honestly, in my opinion, posts like this are sort of dramatic. Let’s realize that the last 100 years the stock market has pretty much continued to go up (with some crashes mixed in) despite everything that’s going on. Including world wars, the Great Depression, major hurricanes, major earthquakes and fires, wars with Korea, wars with Vietnam/Afganistan, constant Middle East fighting, several political scandals like watergate, the 2008 recession that scared everyone, a global pandemic, the Cold War, and so many different things. 

At the end of the day, US companies have and will continue to make more and more insane amounts of money. Stocks will continue to rise even after some downfalls. Trump will only be president for 4 years if not less if something were to happen to him in old age. 

If you’re gonna retire in less than 5-10 years you shouldn’t be 100% in stocks anyways. If you’re going to be retiring in 25-30 years this is all just a blip on the screen. Go pick a spot on the stock market anywhere the last 100 years and then look up news articles from that year. People were scared of something. Yet compare that stock price to the stock price now and you’ll find you would have made a lot of money despite everything that’s happened since that year.

I have a portfolio where I am currently probably taking more risk than I can stomach, and whenever I end up being in a spot where I have put more than 50% of my Net worth in the stock market, this is how I feel. Of course, I know that if I didn't feel that way also 4-5 years ago I would have a lot more money now.  I am also heavily invested in China now. I believe they are set to go on a bull run, but of course maybe they fall 50% again also.

My investment in China is for two reasons: a) I truly believe they are undervalued and the slow reduction of political risk when Xi starts supporting private businesses will rever them back to their true value, b) a combination of a) with some emotional investing. I lost a lot on China in the past and I want to see it rebound. At the same time I am salty for all the gains I left on the table on PLTR. This is emotional investing. But I can't help it. I also can't stop it yet (i.e. I cannot sell my China exposure until mid March as I added to my position recently and my employer has a rule that doesn't allow me to reverse trade ISINs for 30 days.)

Below my portfolio percentages, on a 235k portfolio. I'm shitting my pants now because - even though I don't necessarily need this money (at least the amount that is invested) in the next 10 years, I also have trouble dealing with the idea of my hard earned money possibly droppnig by 40-50+% and needing 10 years to rebound. How can I forget this feeling? When I am less than 50% invested, then I always tell myself ""if there is a crash, you have 50% left to DCA and then you can recover faster). 

An idea is to switch to a golden butterfly, which should have lower drops, but I really, really, really, do not like bond ETFs.

For reference, I live in Europe, in a country where tax for UCITS ETF capital gains is 0%.

I would appreciate any advice on how to shake this feeling off and go all in in some boglehead type portfolio (or Golden butterfly - but I really don't like 40% exposure to bond ETFs). Or any other portfolio. How can I end up investing at least 200k without this feeling. Or any strategies to hedge risk.

But I noticed that today and did some light googling and apparently that’s supposed to be pretty damn significant for the biggest health insurance company in the world. Its value has also fallen 14% in 6 months too.

Maybe I’m worried about nothing, but I thought that’s like kind of a newsworthy thing usually.

Also, this part is freakin me out, might be bs, but it’s very weird: like dozens of people all over social media in the last 48 hours are Claiming they and 20-30K other people are getting laid off there. Again maybe that isn’t true but it seems odd that lots of Joe shmo Karen types are making tik toks, tweets and Facebook posts saying they have to take a buy out by May 1st. I think there’s a larger Reddit post as well. 

There’s literally no media coverage at all on that tho. So like could be a total rumor. Tho an oddly specific insane one. But I thought it odd that the stock price also fell 4.29% today and like maybe that’s not actually that much in the grand scheme… but maybe it’s also a big deal? Like tik tok rumors don’t usually cost billions of dollars lol. 

Any insight would be rad! Would be lovely for any friendly folk to alleviate my concerns if possible lol.

They did better than they had than In the past 3 quarters.

This I’d say is a good to excellent buy. It’s not comparable to AI growth but you should always be diversifying your portfolio. At this time the stock is 211, id say it’s a 9/10 good time to buy. 

Advice is I’d wait to see more positive trends as it’s trying to find its ground,however 40percent down in 1 night is almost certainly an overreaction…I’m unsure about yearly prediction because that’s just too far to take serious however is it likely to correct at say 240?

I been working on rebalancing my portfolio and would love some thoughts - I primarily trimmed down my single stock picks into ETFs. 

I’m 30 and my wife is 27 - we have a NW of about 800K across brokerage and retirement accounts.

I am not sure how bond ETFs work honestly. Take for example the Bond etfs that are proposed for a golden butterfly portfolio, TLT for logn term and SHY for short term. My questions:

1) Are these giving a yield (coupon)? If I look them up in Yahoo it shows a yield of 4.27% for TLT and 3.9% for SHY

2) Why are they fluctuating so much? I see prices have dropped a lot in the last 5 years (I guess due to the IR increases), so I guess they don't work as a normal bond that you can keep to maturity and take your initial capital back?

  
Example: If I make a fake portfolio on Yahoo finance starting from 2nd January 2020 and I add SHY and TLT, then TLT is -35.5% and SHY is -3%. Why does TLT fluctuate so much?

Herc is based near me in SWFL, I saw them spin off of Hertz Rentals some years ago. With good execution, they become market leader and the stock rises accordingly.

Most interesting news today is the hope that the meeting between Russian/US officials may end the three-year war in Ukraine, in addition to release of the Grok-3 model from xAI (Elon Musk's AI startup.)

News: [Musk S Xai Debuts Grok 3 Ai Bot Touting Benchmark Superiority](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/musk-s-xai-debuts-grok-3-ai-bot-touting-benchmark-superiority)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)/every semis and AI facing stock

**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.

These assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)

**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, SMH, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.

**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a “Colossus supercomputer,” for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.

Today, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.

**Related Tickers:** ARM, AMD, INTC

**Offhand Comments:** May see reversal of news if performance doesn't match claims.

**Ticker:** [**HEES (Herc Holdings Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HEES&p=d)

**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)

**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.

**Related Tickers:** URI, HRI

**Ticker:** [**NKE (Nike Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.

**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.

**Related Tickers:** LULU, UAA

**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.

These claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)

**Technicals:** This catalyst has been ""semi-leaked"" for the past week but not ""fully confirmed"", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.

**Risks:** Pretty much a ""wait for the news announcement"" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.

**Related Tickers:** BA, NOC, HAL

**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)

**Catalyst:** BIDU earnings with an EPS of ¥19.18 vs ¥14.13. Revenue of ¥34.1 billion vs ¥33.4 billion.

The company noted a 178% quarter-over-quarter increase in external API calls for its ERNIE AI bot and expects its AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025.

Additionally, Apollo Go has commenced 100% fully driverless operations across China since February.

  
**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The technology sector is rapidly advancing in AI and autonomous driving technologies. Something interesting over the weekend was Xi meeting with private sector business leaders, signaling that China would be more friendly to business leaders (like Jack Ma)  
  
**Risks:** It's China.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

*Edited 2/19/25 to add 2 'value' picks for comparison.*

Hi, all.  
I'm an unabashed momentum/performance chaser.  I used to hope for a month or two of continuation, but as I've aged and mellowed I'm looking more for 6 months to 1 year out.  

I started a thread a few days ago called [How I Pick Stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iprnuo/how_i_pick_stocks_anyone_else/), hoping to find like-minded people.  I found a few, but in general I got negativity.  Even a recommendation to ""VOO and chill""; here in r/Stocks and not r/Investing, I couldn't believe it.  
I also asked some of the nay-sayers to tell us how they pick stocks, but none did.  

So here's my thesis: picking winning stocks doesn't have to be hard.  Look at a chart and if it's going up smoothly over a year or more, that company is probably a pretty good one that's doing good things in the world.  

My benchmark these days is Walmart.  Here's its [1-year & 5-year charts](https://imgur.com/a/walmart-1y-5y-gHcW2K8).  Just steadily up and to the right.  [FOX](https://imgur.com/a/fFAXqeF) is even smoother on the 1y, but not as good on the 5y.  

Those are the kinds of stocks I'll be looking for: up and to the right, smoothly. Probably for a year or more.  And they'll need to be companies I've at least heard of, which generally means they'll be ""large enough.""  I won't be looking at Fundamentals or P/Es or dividends or anything else.  *Just price action.*  

If you explained very basically a stock price chart to a 5th grader, and then asked them if they'd rather have their report card money in [AMD or WMT](https://imgur.com/a/Zz6hZee), those are the kinds of choices I'll be making.  

If it's going up, buy it.  When it stops going up, sell it and buy something else.  

And this isn't something that should take a lot of time.  To that end, I'll post updates twice a month: at the beginning, and in the middle.  This starting one is in the middle.  Being that it's the first one, the 5 picks I make will go on at the Opening price on Tuesday 2/18/25 for each ticker.  

In practice I'd put a **10% trailing stop** on each one, so I'll do that here, virtually.  Those would track intra-day highs, but I might not track them to that level of detail.  Closing-to-closing should be close enough.  And I guess that's about it for the rules.  I'll post percent gains or losses for each position each update.  

My first 5 picks, in alphabetical order:  
**FOX** at 52.35, **the open on Tuesday, 2/18/25.** (Monday was a holiday.)    
**HOOD** 63.31  
**HWM** 136.25  
**IBKR** 236.00  
**WMT**  103.72

stocks,US Congress Trade Tracker - CACI International ($CACI) - Military Contractor,1is2c12,Both-Shelter952,2025-02-17 21:42:29,43,0.86,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1is2c12/us_congress_trade_tracker_caci_international_caci/,"\*I'm new to posting on Reddit. If there's a more appropriate sub to post this stock pitch, please recommend.

**Stock pitch:** CACI International (**$CACI**). The genesis of the idea to invest is based on following congress stock trade disclosures and following up with due diligence for potential conflicts of interest (see ""**Cisneros**"" further below). FYI I'm long $CACI.

**Company Overview:** $CACI is an American multinational professional services & IT company that provides services to the US Federal Gov't/DoD/military/etc. (military contractor). A significant portion of their revenue (TBD%) comes from US Government contracts. With \~$10bn alone in primarily new Contract Awards since their Q4 Earnings (08.07.2024) split over a contract term length of \~5-10yrs (which looks to include a small % re-contracting). See the following links for summarized awarded contract details (Ctrl+F: Quarter Contract Awards).

1. [CACI | CACI Reports Results for Its Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year and Issues Fiscal Year 2025 Guidance](https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2024/CACI-Reports-Results-for-Its-Fiscal-2024-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-and-Issues-Fiscal-Year-2025-Guidance/default.aspx)
2. [CACI | CACI Reports Results for Its Fiscal 2025 First Quarter and Raises Fiscal Year Guidance](https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2024/CACI-Reports-Results-for-Its-Fiscal-2025-First-Quarter-and-Raises-Fiscal-Year-Guidance/default.aspx)
3. [CACI | CACI Reports Results for Its Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter and Raises Fiscal Year Guidance](https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2025/CACI-Reports-Results-for-Its-Fiscal-2025-Second-Quarter-and-Raises-Fiscal-Year-Guidance/default.aspx)

**$CACI provides the following Services** (summarized via Copilot AI):

* Intelligence Solutions: Offering advanced analytics, cyber security, and intelligence operations support.
* Engineering Services: Providing systems engineering, logistics, and lifecycle support.
* IT Solutions: Delivering enterprise IT, network modernization and software development.
* Mission Support: Enhancing operational readiness and mission success through various support services

**Share Price:** Plummeting. Share price is down \~40% since Nov 2024, which aligns in timing with Trump's formation of DOGE announcement. Negative sentiment seems to suggest major concerns for government contracting companies re: DOGE cost cutting initiatives. Fair, I'm sure there's bloat with government contractors. However, this is all despite $CACI posting strong Q2 2025 Earnings. (see below)

$CACI also went as far to call out DOGE as a positive in their recent Q2 2025 earnings deck (01.23.2025)

[PowerPoint Presentation](https://s21.q4cdn.com/708811725/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/CACI-Q2-FY25-Earnings-Slides-vFINAL.pdf) (see slide 6)

Q2 2025 Earnings Summary: From Yahoo (01.22.2025)

*""Revenues of $2.1 billion, up 14.5% YoY*

*Net income of $109.9 million and diluted EPS of $4.88, up 30% YoY*

*Adjusted net income of $134.2 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $5.95, up 36% YoY*

*EBITDA of $232.9 million and EBITDA margin of 11.1%, up 180 bps YoY""*

CEO Message: ""Our second quarter reflected another exceptional period for CACI. Financial results were strong across the board with double-digit revenue growth, increased profitability, healthy cash flow, and growing backlog. In addition, we closed and integrated the previously announced strategic acquisitions of Azure Summit and Applied Insight,"" … ""With the momentum we see in our business, we are again able to **raise our fiscal year 2025 guidance**, and we are well on track to achieve the three-year financial targets we introduced at our Investor Day. Our strategy, capabilities, and performance position CACI extremely well to continue providing long-term value for our customers and our shareholders.""

Enter Congressman **Gilbert Cisneros** (Dem / House / California).

**Gilbert Cisneros** disclosed dozens of trades on Feb 11th, with $CACI standing out as a significant investment of $15-50k (aka upwards of approx. \[30%\] of a congressman's gross annual salary). Note: It seems that a lot of these trades are going under the radar with the sheer number of disclosure / trade volume recently.

Cisneros purchased $CACI on Jan. 31, 2025 at \~$386; price is now \~$338 (-12%).  

**Potential Conflict of Interests (via Copilot):**

1. Gilbert Cisneros sits on the **House Committee on Armed Services (HASC)**, responsible in-part for:

   * Oversight and legislation related to the DoD, and the US Armed forces
   * Defense Policy: Shaping and funding defense policies and programs.
   * Military Operations: Overseeing ongoing military operations.
   * Acquisition and Industrial Base Policy: Managing defense procurement and industrial base policies.
   * Technology Transfer and Export Controls: Regulating the transfer of defense-related technologies

CACI International operates in areas such as defense technology, cybersecurity, and intelligence solutions, which fall under the HASC committee's jurisdiction. The HASC ensures that companies like CACI comply with defense policies and contribute to national security objectives.

 2. Additionally, Gilbert Cisneros sits on the **Intelligence & Special Operations subcommittee**, responsible in-part for:

* Military and National Intelligence: Overseeing intelligence operations and programs
* Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Proliferation: Managing efforts to counter terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
* Special Operations Forces: Supervising the activities and policies related to special operations force

CACI International provides intelligence and cybersecurity solutions, making it relevant to this subcommittee. The subcommittee ensures that CACI's services align with national security and intelligence strategies.

3. Additionally, Gilbert Cisneros sits on the **Military Personnel subcommittee**, responsible in-part for:

* Military Personnel Policy: Managing policies related to military personnel and their families.
* Military Health Care: Overseeing health care services for military personnel.
* Morale, Welfare, and Recreation: Ensuring the well-being and morale of service members.
* Military Education and Training: Supervising educational programs for military personnel

These committees play a significant role in military modernization. It oversees the Department of Defense (DoD) and is responsible for the annual defense authorization bill, which includes funding and policy decisions related to military modernization.

Previously, Cisneros, as the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel Readiness (under Biden's term), was involved in the decision to cancel the ongoing work for the military's new MyTravel program, which was to modernize / replace the DefenseTravelSystem. Personally, I don’t know enough to speak more critically about this - but I found it interesting that $CACI does IT network modernization as part of their offered solutions. (see - [Lawmaker summons Pentagon official over canceled travel software](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2023/07/03/lawmaker-summons-pentagon-official-over-canceled-travel-software/))

**TLDR:** Why is a US Congressman spending 10-30% of their gross annual salary, buying shares in a publicly traded military services company ($CACI) while (1.) the share price is plummeting, and (2.) while also sitting on congressional committees that oversee the same said company.  

Yes, this is speculative in nature, and I am not an investment professional.

If you've made it this far reading, I have to say, a part of the reason I'm making this post is my surprise by the lack of attention towards this particular trade disclosure. Congress buying military stocks usually gets a lot of media buzz. For example, Congresswoman **Debbie Wasserman Schulz** disclosed on Nov 20, 2024 she bought shares in **Viasat** (a satellite company with military contracts). Share price skyrocketed +40% over the next few days thereafter - to which I don't believe there was any other coincidental bullish catalysts at that time. Come Dec 2024, Viasat won a significant military contract. All the while Debbie sits on a congress committee impacting military contracts (House Committee on Appropriations). Said simply, I believe there's a correlation between politicians buying shares in military companies, and future good news for said military company.

If you have any value-add due diligence or contrarian viewpoints, feel free to share. I'm hoping this post grabs someone's attention with a deep understanding of this company/industry. ",0,,2025-02-17,0.0,0.9991,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.249775,0.0,0.1248875,56.244375000000005,positive
stocks,What is so difficult about beating the market?,1is1rrv,Lambwarts,2025-02-17 21:14:08,0,0.44,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1is1rrv/what_is_so_difficult_about_beating_the_market/,"
I’m 20 years old and fairly new to investing. Deposited 80% of my investments into VT & VOO (inspired by Bogleheads) and the other 20% in individual stocks. So far I’ve lost 2% due to some stupid decision-making when I just began but since then things have been improving (thankfully). 

But I’m seeing statistics that something like 90% of retail investors underperform the S&P 500 and 95% of day traders lose money?? I’m thinking of really delving more into retail investing because of people like Chris Camillo but using the inversion principle… what causes such gloomy statistics among retail investors? 

There are numerous strategies I found online (CANSLIM etc) which I haven’t really researched thoroughly or experimented with so my knowledge is painfully limited. Do none of these strategies work? What do the 90% do that outlying people like Camillo don’t? If such strategies are publicly available why is the failure rate still so high? 

Is it trying to time the market? Selling the high and buying the dip? Is it emotional investing or just poor stock picking? 

Beating the market isn’t a fool’s endeavour since retail investors have done with with excellent returns but I just really dk what to avoid and what to learn with regards to investing/trading to attain such returns? 

Any edification is welcome. I am really quite new to all this so forgive me if I sound extremely ignorant.

stocks,"Thomson Reuters stock (TRI) was falsely accused of ""social deception"" by special govt. employee Elon Musk",1is1fba,TheComebackKid74,2025-02-17 20:57:02,845,0.91,146,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1is1fba/thomson_reuters_stock_tri_was_falsely_accused_of/,"Below is an excerpt from a news article. I'm hesitant to post any links on this story, because alot of people believe they were politically slanted when posting on a different sub.  After I explain the current news, below is a summary about TRI's present and future, dividend yield, how many consecutive raises and etc.  This is not intended to be a political post !

Thomson Reuters denied on Thursday accusations that the company was involved in ""large-scale social deception"" on behalf of the US government, saying the claims misrepresented its work with the Department of Defense.

On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk posted on X: “Reuters was paid millions of dollars by the US government for ‘large scale social deception.’ They’re a total scam.”

On Truth Social, US President Donald Trump echoed the claim, calling Reuters “Radical Left” and demanding that it “GIVE BACK THE MONEY, NOW!”

Thomson Reuters Special Services CEO Steve Rubley told CNN that “recent public discourse” has “inaccurately represented the nature of the business” between Thomson Reuters Special Services (TRSS) and the Department of Defense.

He added that the accusations wrongly conflated the Reuters news agency with TRSS, which are separate legal entities that operate “independently” and have separate boards of directors.

So basically Thomson Reuters news agency (ticker symbol TRI) and Thomson Reuters Special Services are two separate divisions. Both are owned by parent company Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI stock did not recieve any govt money and, this issue has nothing to with them. Still TRI's stock fell 3% this past Friday. This happened after the price just rallied to all time highs, after releasing earnings on Feb 6th. I belive it's reasonable to assume that the false allegations caused the share price drop this past Friday. Though I could be wrong, and this could be a pullback or a little of both. Even now TRI stock is still up 12% in the past 30 days.

Thomson Ruters (TRI) stock is viewed as a boring news stock. Yet it is actually a sleeper Tech stock, and one that pays a Dividend at that. TRI just raised their dividend by 10% after lastest earnings and has a current yield of 1.38%. They have also raised their dividend for 32 consecutive years. TRI will be moving to the Nasdaq and leaving the NYSE by approximately Feb 25th. TRI is one of the more solid dividend stocks that I have never seen mentioned on this sub. They serve the Law and Tax industry with generative AI software and applications. They also happen to invest up to 200 million a year into AI via Venture Captial. One of the 23 companies they invested was an AI company, and they later bought that company.

From this Stock Titan Article here ...

https://www.stocktitan.net/news/TRI/thomson-reuters-announces-new-150m-corporate-venture-capital-kgryjz8tu42j.html

Thomson Reuters (NYSE/TSX: TRI) has announced the launch of its second Corporate Venture Capital Fund, valued at $150 million. This new fund builds upon the success of its first $100 million fund launched in 2021. Operating as Thomson Reuters Ventures, Fund 2 will target Series A investments in early-stage technology companies across Legal Technology, Tax & Accounting, Fintech, Risk Fraud & Compliance, and News & Media markets.

The first fund has already made 23 investments, including Materia, an agentic AI company that was later acquired by Thomson Reuters. The new fund will maintain a focus on financial discipline and companies developing technologies addressing professional challenges, particularly in Gen AI applications. The initiative is part of Thomson Reuters' 'Build, Partner, Buy' strategy, aiming to strengthen its leadership position in professional technology solutions.

For those of you who only hold Index funds, mutual funds, Reits and etc. you are better off ignoring this. For those of you interested in a good growing stock that pays a Dividend, you might want to take a deeper look into TRI. TRI provides you significant growth potentia (imo), and at the same time offers dividend growth with 30+ years of consecutive raises.

This not finacial advise, please do your own Due Dillgence.

stocks,Nebius (NBIS) Has Long-Term Potential But May Be Priced To Perfection,1irz32e,Fountainheadusa,2025-02-17 19:05:25,130,0.93,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1irz32e/nebius_nbis_has_longterm_potential_but_may_be/,"**While Nebius has shot up 135% in the past year and is approaching fever pitch as a speculative AI infrastructure investment, it does have long-term potential to justify buying on declines.**   
Nebius was carved out of the Yandex group, an erstwhile Russian company known as the Yahoo of Russia. After sanctions due to the Ukraine war and the resulting spinoff, it is now a European company with US operations, little or no Russian exposure, and no additional geopolitical risks.  
**Nvidia has a 0.3% stake in the company, and a strategic partnership to expand AI infrastructure to Small and Medium businesses beyond hyperscalers.**

  
**Nebius has five revenue segments – Data Center, Toloka, Triple Ten, Clickhouse and AVRide.**

I want to focus on the main data center segment in this post.  
**Datacenter**  
The best and most strategic segment is the data center, and the key reason to invest in the company is to take full advantage of AI needs beyond the hyperscalers. I expect at least 100% annual revenue growth in the next two years from the data center, slowing down to 50% in year 3.  
Nebius is going all out in creating enough capacity for demand in the next two to three years.  
It launched its first data center in the US, in Kansas City to start operations in Q1 2025 with an initial capacity of 5 MW, scalable up to 40 MW.  
**Further expansion plans – most likely all of that is Nvidia’s B200 GPUs.**  
• Finland 25MW to 75MB by late 2025 or early 2026.  
• France – 5MW Launching in November 2025.  
• Kansas City – Second facility with 5MW to expand to 40MW.  
• One to two further greenfield data centers in Europe.  
**Datacenter offerings** include computing power or GPU rentals, as well as the more specialized Platform as a Service (PaaS) with its AI studio, which provides customers with options for OpenAI or DeepSeek models, among others. Pricing is based on usage and token generation to accommodate medium-sized, smaller, and/or domain-specific customers.  
**Fragmentation likely:** As the AI data center industry progresses, I believe, Inferencing and modeling requirements will be fragmented and domain-specific. The DeepSeek software and modeling workarounds do suggest this market could easily be targeted by customized requirements, where brute computing power as the norm will morph into specialized or customized requirements. In which case while customers could contract for larger GPU training clusters, they would also look for cheaper inference solutions, which rely on software enhancements. This is likely to happen over time and may well work to Nebius’ advantage since they want to go beyond pure GPU rentals and provide a full stack – this could be both a challenge and an opportunity and it would be crucial to get more visibility in Nebius’ offerings or services as the year progresses specially compared to competition like CoreWeave.  
**Lowering training costs:** While there remains a huge cloud about what DeepSeek did spend on training, and even as 2025 seems to be secure because of the large Capex of $320 Bn committed by the hyperscalers, it would be remiss to not acknowledge that the trend would seek lower training costs as well – in which case a) data center computing power will be at risk and b) pricing could be the main differentiator. As of now, Goldman Sachs is projecting data center demand to exceed supply by about 2:1, and the gap is unlikely to be filled even with rapid deployment through 2026.  
**Spend more to earn more:** Most of the forecasted growth is based on Capex possibly over $2.5Bn in 2025 with an additional $2.5Bn to $3Bn in 2026. Currently, Nebius is well capitalized with about $2.9Bn in cash, but if data centers don’t generate enough cash, there could be dilution to raise more capital or the sale of stakes in their 4 other businesses. This is very likely to happen in 2026.

**Negatives and challenges**

Provide value to customers beyond brute computing power: Over time, data center rentals will become commoditized and price-sensitive. The DeepSeek modeling workarounds suggest that brute computing power will morph into smaller specialized or customized requirements. This could also work to Nebius’ advantage since they can provide a full stack, i.e., a challenge and an opportunity.  
**Pricing could be a challenge:** The trend towards seeking lower training costs should continue – as of now Goldman Sachs is projecting data center demand to exceed supply by about 2:1, and the gap is unlikely to be filled even with rapid deployment through 2026, but Nebius needs to stay on top of it, to ensure they generate enough cash to continue spending on growth.  
**High Capex Needs:** Most of the forecasted growth is based on Capex possibly $2.5Bn to $3Bn in 2025 and 2029 each – currently Nebius is well capitalized with over $2.9Bn in cash, but investors will need to be patient with this outlay first and prepared for dilution.

**Valuation**

Nebius had forecasted to reach an ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) Run Rate of – $750Mn to $1Bn for 2025, which is based on about $60-80Mn of ARR in Dec 2025 times 12. It’s not the ARR in February. It would grow from the current $300 Mn to $ 875 Mn by the end of 2025. Normally annual revenues are much lower than ARR – a lot of ARR is deferred revenue because the ARR includes contracted revenues, which are then pro-rated for the year. An ARR of $875Mn at the midpoint could imply 2025 revenue of between $400 and $500Mn. (This is still about 3x the estimated 2024 revenue of $137Mn – so there is tremendous growth. (But at this stage a lot of estimates!)  
At a market cap of $10.4Bn, we’re looking at over 20x to 25x, 2025 revenue, so the price may have gotten ahead of itself.  
**This is a thinly traded company with rampant speculation, and I think the best move would be to sell 25% to 50% before earnings, should the quarterly results and forecasts disappoint.** **I’m already making a decent profit in a short time, my cost is $32.35,** and plan to keep the rest for the long term. Nebius reports pre-market on Thursday 20th, Feb.  
**I would like to see more visibility before committing to invest more.**

**Competition**

**CoreWeave** (which is private) and also an Nvidia strategic partner had estimated revenue of $2.4Bn in 2024, and with the addition of 9 new data centers to 23 very likely to have around $8Bn of sales in 2025.  
CoreWeave was last valued at around $23Bn but is targeting an IPO valuation of $35Bn thus giving it an estimated sales multiple of anywhere between just 4-9x for 2025, way below Nebius.  
Even if we assume that the other businesses contribute an additional 25% or $125Mn in 2025 revenues we’re still valuing Nebius much higher than CoreWeave – a larger and more established competitor with Nvidia as a partner, and Microsoft as a customer.

**That makes me wary; I’d be happy if my sales estimates are too low, but if they are not, then I would rather take some profit and wait for dips.**",0,,2025-02-17,0.5719,0.9943,0.5270968079566956,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.6775,0.39532260596752167,0.5364113029837608,76.82056514918804,very_positive

Just noticed this article about Under Armour ($UAA) - link in comments. IMO, it seems like quite a good candidate for potential upside in coming months. However, I've been known for being regarded, so NFA.

I'll just summarize key points for you all:

Current market cap: 2.955B.

Currently trading at $7.10 per share, the company has recently shown signs of progress in its turnaround efforts. In its most recent earnings, Under Armour surpassed expectations across all key metrics, including sales, gross margin of 47.47%, operating margin, and earnings per share. While the company wasn't profitable over the last twelve months, with a negative EPS of $0.29, analysts predict profitability this year. This strong performance led the company to raise its guidance for the fiscal year 2025, indicating confidence in its near-term outlook. At the core of Under Armour's turnaround efforts is a strategy to ""premiumize"" its brand. The company is prioritizing the development and marketing of higher-quality products, moving away from a volume-driven approach. This shift is expected to enhance brand perception and potentially drive improved EBITDA and EPS performance in the coming years.

# SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

* Strong brand recognition in athletic apparel
* Recent EPS beats and improved gross margins
* Successful cost management initiatives

Weaknesses:

* Declining sales across various channels and regions
* Challenges in the Asia-Pacific market
* Ongoing North American market reset

Opportunities:

* Brand premiumization strategy
* New marketing initiatives targeting younger demographics
* Innovative product launches in less established categories
* Potential for market share gains in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa

Threats:

* Intense competition in the athletic apparel industry
* Potential economic downturn affecting consumer spending
* Changing consumer preferences and fashion trends
* Promotional pressures in key markets

# Analysts Targets

* Barclays: $8.00 (February 10th, 2025)
* BMO Capital Markets: $12.00 (December 13th, 2024)
* Wells Fargo Securities: $10.00 (December 2nd, 2024)
* Barclays: $12.00 (November 11th, 2024)
* Barclays: $8.00 (August 9th, 2024)
* Morgan Stanley: Downgrade to Underweight (July 23rd, 2024)

Analysts project that Under Armour's earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2025 will be around $0.30, with expectations of growth to $0.37 in the following fiscal year.

stocks,Grail (GRAL) and the Future of Early Cancer Detection: A Data-Driven Perspective,1iro6kj,StarshipFairing,2025-02-17 11:42:42,7,0.62,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iro6kj/grail_gral_and_the_future_of_early_cancer/,"# Is Grail (GRAL) severely undervalued? 

In recent weeks, Grail has seen a significant increase in interest, driven by the broader excitement around AI applications in healthcare. While much of the AI hype has focused on drug discovery for cancer treatment, Grail stands out for its use of AI to detect cancer in its earliest stages—before symptoms appear—through its Galleri test.

# Why Is Grail Gaining Attention?

The Galleri test is a multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test capable of identifying over 50 types of cancer with a single blood draw. Until recently, awareness of Galleri was minimal, but the potential implications are profound: early detection vastly improves survival rates across all cancer types. Instead of waiting until later stages when treatment options become limited and costly, early intervention could save countless lives.

As someone who personally took the Galleri test two months ago (no cancer detected), I was impressed by how simple the process was. It’s fascinating to think that a single blood draw could provide such valuable insights. Seeing Grail’s progress from both a user and an investor perspective makes me even more optimistic about its future.

# A Closer Look at Grail’s Business Fundamentals

* **Proven Technology & Commercialization**: Grail's technology is not just theoretical—it is mature, widely tested, and already on the market. In 2024, the company generated $125 million in revenue, with an expected growth rate of 30% in 2025.
* **Financial Stability**: With $767 million in cash reserves at the end of 2024, Grail anticipates sufficient funding to support operations through 2028.
* **Clinical & Regulatory Progress**: The PATHFINDER 2 trial, conducted in collaboration with the UK’s NHS, is progressing well. An FDA submission is expected by the end of the year, which could open doors for broader adoption.
* **Potential for Insurance Coverage**: Currently, Galleri is not covered by insurance, but given its potential to revolutionize cancer diagnostics, the likelihood of inclusion appears increasingly plausible.

# Market Sentiment and Institutional Interest

Grail was initially acquired by Illumina for **$8 billion** before being spun off. As analysts reevaluate its potential, the valuation question is becoming a focal point. Institutional ownership of GRAL stands at **66.6%**, with **ILMN and management holding 14%**. This means that less than 20% of shares (approximately **6 million shares**) are currently in public circulation, leading to a highly concentrated ownership structure.

Key points influencing institutional sentiment:

* **Cash burn concerns have eased**, as institutions now recognize that the major investments have already been made, and remaining funds are sufficient through 2028.
* **Strong sales momentum**, with 137,000 Galleri tests sold in 2024—matching total sales from 2022 and 2023 combined. Cumulative sales now approach 300,000.
* **Regulatory optimism**, with increasing confidence in FDA approval within the next year.
* **Potential market expansion**, including collaborations with pharmaceutical companies in Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) detection and drug development.

# Future Outlook and Valuation Considerations

As of February 15, 2025, GRAL is trading at **$55** at a valuation of **1.85B**, less than **25% the acquisition cost by Illumina** 4 years ago. If Grail secures FDA approval and insurance coverage, the addressable market for Galleri could expand exponentially. Analysts and institutions are beginning to speculate on what this means for Grail’s valuation—some believe a share price of **$150-$200** is within reach in the near term, depending on continued execution and market sentiment.

With less than **10 million shares actively trading**, any increase in institutional demand could drive further price appreciation. As Grail continues to gain visibility, the coming months will be crucial in determining its long-term trajectory.

1. **$CTLP -  Cantaloupe, Inc**

A quick description of what they do: 

>The company offers integrated solutions for payments processing, logistics, and back-office management.

>It also provides G11 cashless and pulse kits that are 4G LTE digital payment devices for payment and consumer engagement applications; G11 chip kit, a digital reader that accepts contact EMV and contactless EMV payment methods; Engage series comprising Engage and Engage Combo, which are digital touchscreen devices that offers networking, security, and interactivity payment methods; and card touchscreen card readers, including P66, P100, P100Pro, and P30.

While the stock might appear to be expensive on the TTM PE, the forward PE isn't nearly as bad, plus the company is now profitable and growing EPS nicely, so the PEG on the company is actually around 1.12. 

And there was some insider buying recently too:

What I find interesting about the company is that they are working with sports stadiums with their cashless kiosk systems. They currently operate in over 20 stadiums. It's actually a great case study on it for the commanders stadium called out on their site.

**2. $FTI - TechnipFMC plc**

Quick Description of what they do:

>It operates through two segments: Subsea and Surface Technologies. The Subsea segment engages in the design, engineering, procurement, manufacturing, fabrication, installation, and life of field services for subsea systems, subsea field infrastructure, and subsea pipe systems used in oil and gas production and transportation.

>It provides subsea production and processing system; flexible pipe; subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines; vessels; robotics; well and asset services; and Subsea Studio for optimizing the development, execution, and operation of current and future subsea fields.

I'm not the biggest expert around the oil market, but it does it does seem like the offshore market is actually growing. Plus add in the new Trump admin who is talking about ""drill baby drill"", FTI specializes in the offshore drilling market. 

I just think what they do with the subsea oil drilling is really interesting, especially with the use of robotics.

>Shale is still growing. But analysts say fields are beginning to get exhausted, so production is starting to plateau. “Offshore is the only place that’s left to grow. The other thing about offshore, too, is that over the last five years, the average breakeven has come down from $75 \[per barrel\] to $50 or even $45,” said Simon Wong, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.

>In 2025, growth from offshore oil drilling globally could surpass tight oil, or shale growth, for the first time in more than a dozen years, according to Rystad Energy. The consulting firm expects that trend to continue.

In their latest investor presentation, they actually called out that the total company backlog is now the highest level since the merger to create the company. 

They also have authorized their buybacks by 1B and have enough to take our around 10% of the float.

stocks,"Trump's Move for Moving Manufacturing into US, is Strategically good for Automation Revolution.",1irn4nl,EngageWithCaution,2025-02-17 10:59:49,0,0.24,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1irn4nl/trumps_move_for_moving_manufacturing_into_us_is/,"Start by saying, I'm not a Trumper.

Looking ahead 5–10 years, a strategic shift toward advanced, automated manufacturing in the U.S. could yield significant economic benefits. In this scenario, factories would increasingly rely on AI and robotics for design, management, and optimization—enabling tremendous output while reducing dependence on traditional, labor-intensive processes. As a result, the most valuable roles will likely focus on overseeing these sophisticated systems rather than on manual labor.

This evolution in manufacturing is expected to boost demand for companies that supply the necessary infrastructure and equipment—often dubbed “shovel makers.” Firms such as Johnson Controls International (JCI), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), ASML Holding, and Micron Technology (MU) are well positioned to benefit. Additionally, as automated production scales up, there could be a secondary surge in demand for embedded systems, potentially benefiting companies like AMD and Intel.

While this outlook remains speculative, current trends in automation, robotics, and AI suggest that a U.S.-focused, high-tech manufacturing base could provide a strong competitive advantage in the global economy by 2025 and beyond.

This is my Thesis why I think Nationalism is a great priority to have now, because the countries with this infrastructure will win, just like the US won after World War II.

Edit: Yikes, I see you do not have the capacity to look past the word Trump. Okay, my mistake, I forgot we are all hyper sensitive here. 

My main Argument: Tariffs -> Increased Incentive for Moving Manufacturing Jobs into US -> Good for Automation Revolution -> Good for US economy over next 10+ years.  

I can't comment on all the false statements being spammed in the comments by liberals, but I have no arguments for or against Trump, as a person, or any previous president, not worth my time and effort.

stocks,Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple's Earnings,1irmza9,AAPL201620,2025-02-17 10:53:25,3,0.57,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1irmza9/foreign_exchange_impacts_on_apples_earnings/,"**Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple**

The US dollar (USDXY) can have a huge impact on Apple’s revenue and earnings as around 50% of Apple’s sales occur internationally. Much of the past ten years the USDXY has hovered in the 92-98 range. When COVID-19 hit in March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate and the USDXY hovered in the 89-95 range for a majority of the second half of 2021 through early 2022. In early 2022 the Federal reserve started to hike the federal funds rate and did so through the end of 2023. From mid-2022 through today the USDXY has hovered in the 103-113 range. This is is a 10-25% difference. The elevated USDXY poses significant revenue headwinds for Apple as it costs Apple much more to convert back to US dollars on foreign revenue and it also can lead to lower sales volume as Apple has to raise prices in foreign countries to help offset a strong USDXY. A strong USDXY can help Apple when it comes to foreign investment and international expenses, but the revenue and sales impact outweighs any gains in the cost area. Tim Cook cites in Apple’s Q1 2023 earnings call that foreign exchange (FX) impacts had a “nearly 800 basis point impact,” on revenue. In Apple’s latest Q1 2025 earnings call Tim Cook stated that FX would have a negative 2.5% impact on revenue, but that is YoY not compared to 2021 meaning on a constant currency basis compared to 2021 it would be close to the 6-8% range. Below is a five-year chart of the USDXY. Let’s take a look at Apple’s fiscal year 2024 performance with a 6% constant currency adjustment to revenue to compare to FY 2021 on a constant currency basis.

**FY 2024 Example**

Apple’s total net sales in FY 2024 was $391 billion. With a constant currency 6% adjustment it would be $415 billion. Apple’s total cost of sales for FY 2024 was $210 billion. If we add in a 6% negative impact for a weakened USDXY it would be $223 billion. This would mean Apple’s gross margins would have been 52.8% instead of the reported 46.2% for FY 2024. Apple’s adjusted diluted EPS for FY 2024 would have been around $7.55/share vs the reported $6.75 adjusting for the one-tax payment made in Q4 2024. Here is the math:

Revenue: $415 billion

Cost of Sales: $223 billion

Operation Expenses: $57.5 billion

Effective Tax Rate: 15.8%

Total Outstanding Shares: \~15 billion

($415 -$223)=gross margin -($57.5) = operating income \*(15.8%)= ($113.25)/15=$7.55

As you can see, FY 2024 EPS would have been 12% higher on a constant currency basis compared to FY 2021. Gross margin would have been 660 basis points higher. The strong USDXY has a significant impact on Apple’s earnings. I think the second half of FY 2025 FY 2026 could be a big growth year for Apple on paper if the USDXY weakens and Apple’s hardware replacement cycle follows its normal 3–4-year cycle. The last big upgrade cycle took place during the end of 2020-2021.

While this is still very theoretical and speculative (but most worrying this crazy theory is looking more and more like reality given Trump's first 30 days), I’m increasingly concerned about the potential for increased political and regulatory uncertainty that could impact US equities.

My current portfolio is heavily weighted in US stocks, and I'm thinking about strategies to hedge or reduce exposure if such a scenario were to unfold. I’m particularly worried about:

* Heightened volatility and political risk premiums
* Potential capital flight and shifts in investor sentiment
* The long-term structural impact on corporate governance and profitability

What are some strategies or alternative asset classes you’ve found effective in mitigating this kind of risk? Would diversification into international equities, commodities, or maybe even cash be a smart move? I'm interested in both short-term tactical adjustments and longer-term hedging ideas.

  
Given the number of Tech-Bro Billionaires at his inauguration they are definitely pushing some sort of agenda, so I don't know how US tech equities will fare vs other US equities... or whether they will just be there to sweep up cheap stock/land/who-knows-what.

So my DD is below. Would love everyone's thoughts. My cost is around $199 and have around 70 stocks.I am holding till at least $260.

**Introduction**

Onto Innovation (Tickr: ONTO) is a manufacturer and provider of equipment and software for semiconductor manufacturers. Their product lineup includes equipment for defect inspection, metrology, lithography, photoluminescence and many others required for semiconductor manufacturing and AI packing.  To put it simply, they manufacture and sell equipment that make sure that chips are manufactured and packed optimally, doesn’t have wastage and meet standards . The firm officially came into existence in October 2019 from the merger of Rudolph Technologies and Nanometrics Incorporated.

**The Bull Case for Onto Innovation**

The bull case for Onto Innovation is underpinned by two factors – the continued growth of semiconductor industry powered by demand for AI, and Onto’s market leadership in packaging and metrology. I am not going to talk about the former but would like to touch upon some details of the latter. Onto’s technology in advanced packaging (2.5D and 3D integration) is considered superior to competition. Further Onto’s metrology solutions (precise measurement of chip components) are industry-leading. Among Onto’s customers are almost all the largest chip foundries and memory manufacturers in the world – TSMC, Intel, Samsung, Micron Technology etc.

Onto’s technical capabilities are also reflected in their financial performance to date. 2024 full year revenue was $987MM (+21% vs. 2023, 15% CAGR vs. 2020) and generated healthy cash of $246MM (+43% over 2023). 2024 Q4 EPS was $1.51 exceeding Zacks Consensues of $1.39 and well more than the $1.06 EPS in Q4 2023. The 2023 closing balance sheet was extremely healthy with a total debt of only $19MM vs. total assets of \~$2B and a cash balance of \~$700MM.

ONTO stock has a 100% buy rating from the 10 analysts that cover it and they have target prices ranging from $230 to $275.

**My DCF**

My DCF is very back of the envelope but the output aligns with the numbers that analysts have come to.

The FCFE is estimated to grow at the same rate as projected revenue growth which ranges from 14% to 26% in 2025. I took the mid-point of 20% and assumed that the growth will linearly taper to terminal growth of 3% by 2034 (which in my opinion is a very conservative assumption). CoE is 11.01% based on Aswath Damodaran’s estimation for semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Ignored the minor debt and any dilution that my come due to employee stock options. Based on this analysis, target price is $255 vs. current price of \~$175.

TLDR: ONTO Innovation with their superior capabilities is likely to ride the AI wave and reach a target price of $260. ",0,,2025-02-16,0.3818,0.989,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.5336,0.0,0.2668,63.339999999999996,positive

Long story short I can no longer actively trade individual equities (work at financial firm with trading restriction). Thankfully all my current holdings are grandfathered, but I am free to trade ETF's and derivatives thereof so I was looking for something that could be a little more aggressive. Looked through a long list of the usual suspects of ETF's, but stumbled upon ADPV. Basically it selects 25 of the top-performing stocks in the market during bull runs, and then reverts to treasuries during bear markets. Ultimately I'm hoping this will get me exposure to new up-and-coming stocks/IPO's etc since I can't buy them myself, and the hedge is more of a bonus than anything.

Here are the drawbacks I can see:

1. 1% expense ratio. I pretty much hold all equities and index funds currently with zero ER or close to it, so this one hurts. But maybe it's worth it to scratch my trading itch which can no longer be satisfied.
2. Low volume. This would be for B&H and not for a huge portion of my portfolio so I don't think this would be an issue but would welcome your thoughts/negative experiences with low-volume/liquidity ETF's.
3. The methodology for rotating in and out of the 25 tickers isn't clear. So that's leaving a lot up to the fund management. Current top holding is PLTR (bought in 2023!) which may account for a lot of their recent performance.
4. Not much history as it's only a couple years old. However looking at their top holdings and buy dates they've done very well getting ahead of the curve on some big movers. Past performance not indicative..ofc ofc

stocks,"Original Research - Avoid Baidu ($BIDU): ""Don't Get Tricked By China's AOL""; OR Why Its “Global AI” Hype Falls Flat",1iqyofa,NYCandrun,2025-02-16 13:22:31,40,0.76,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iqyofa/original_research_avoid_baidu_bidu_dont_get/,"Baidu loves to sell itself as China’s leading AI innovator. Western investors often lump it in with Chinese “tech champions.” But a closer look reveals the truth: Baidu’s overseas presence is negligible—less than 1% of revenue—despite years of flashy announcements about AI labs, cloud services, and self-driving projects outside China. Its so-called global ambitions have barely moved the needle.

Baidu’s inability to generate meaningful overseas revenue, despite years of aggressive AI branding and expansion efforts, is not just a matter of tough market conditions—it is a clear indicator of deep structural problems within the company. This failure reflects fundamental issues with strategy execution, capital allocation, leadership decision-making, and competitive positioning.

In my view, Baidu is kind of like the worst house on a dangerous street: it's an aging property with structural issues, stuck in a declining neighborhood where better-built businesses have already moved on to safer, more lucrative markets. Investors hoping for a turnaround are betting on renovations that won't materialize, while smarter money flows into sturdier, globally competitive multi-nationals like Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, and BYD.

Baidu isn’t just in a tough spot—it’s in a market that’s moving past it.

# The Unfulfilled Dream of “China’s Google”

Baidu was once hailed as “China’s Google,” dominating a market where Google was blocked. That moniker created an expectation that it would naturally go global—just like Google did. However, every major overseas push from Baidu has fizzled:

* Japan Search Engine (launched in 2007) never surpassed low-single-digit market share and shut down in 2015.
* Southeast Asia Utility Apps saw initial downloads (DU Battery Saver, etc.) but failed to retain users; many apps were plagued by adware allegations.
* India Ban abruptly cut off a huge market in 2020 when geopolitical tensions led to restrictions on Chinese apps.
* Cloud and Robotaxis remain mostly China-centric, without the global scale of Alibaba Cloud or Huawei’s data centers.

Instead of becoming a global behemoth, Baidu is stuck with near-100% reliance on China’s ad market and domestic AI cloud business. Its “global AI champion” pitch sounds exciting, but there’s little actual revenue to back it up.

# Management’s Stop-and-Start Strategy

One reason for Baidu’s stagnation abroad is its on-again, off-again international focus:

* Internal shakeups and management turmoil kept the business pivoting from search to apps, from apps to AI, from AI to EV software, etc.
* These abrupt strategy shifts wasted capital and left foreign users unconvinced and Western rivals unchallenged.
* ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent moved faster and more decisively, seizing digital opportunities at home and abroad.

All this has left Baidu vulnerable to shifts in China’s macro and regulatory landscape—unlike peers that truly diversified overseas.

# Meanwhile, Other Chinese Companies Are Thriving Abroad

While Baidu’s overseas revenue remains a rounding error, several Chinese companies have systematically expanded beyond their home market—often capturing significant shares of revenue abroad:

**Lenovo**

* Generates \~75% of its revenue overseas in PCs, servers, and services.
* Successfully acquired IBM’s PC and server businesses, scaling up a global supply chain and brand presence.

**Haier**

* Over 50% of sales come from outside China.
* Bought iconic appliance brands like GE Appliances in the U.S., building localized manufacturing and distribution worldwide.

**Xiaomi**

* Aggressively moved into India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and more, combining cost-competitive smartphones with robust local partnerships.

**BYD & CATL**

* Leading the EV and battery space not just in China, but globally—securing deals with top automakers and scaling in Europe, the U.S., and beyond.

**WuXi Biologics, Transsion, Etc.**

Many other Chinese firms, from biotech to mobile phone brands, have established real foreign footprints that diversify their revenue streams.

These Chinese global players compete head-to-head with Western incumbents in advanced economies and capture demand in emerging markets—all while being priced far below many U.S. or European multinationals.

# Why Investors Should Care About Ex-China Successes 

1. Diversification Away from China’s Economy

Companies with 50–75% of sales overseas are far less vulnerable to a domestic slowdown or stricter policies at home.

2. Genuine Global Growth

These firms have already proven they can localize, partner, or acquire to enter new markets—unlike Baidu, which talks big but executes poorly.

3. Undervalued vs. Global Peers

Sentiment around “Chinese risk” keeps valuations low. However, the actual risk for globally diversified firms is materially different—and in many ways lower—than for a purely domestic player like Baidu.

4. Fast-Compounding International Revenues

If emerging markets in India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East continue to boom—or if Western consumers embrace Chinese EVs and hardware—companies like Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, and BYD are already positioned to grab that growth.

# The Bottom Line: Steer Clear of Baidu, Focus on the Real Global Champs

* Baidu Is a Not-So-Awesome “China-Only” Story

Its domestic ad revenues are plateauing, short-video competitors are eating market share, and foreign expansions are just pilot projects that haven’t delivered meaningful sales.

* Baidu Overseas Hype Is Empty

A decade of repeated attempts—from search in Japan to robotaxis in the UAE—has not yielded substantial user adoption or revenue. There’s little reason to believe another pivot will magically pay off.

* Others Have Cracked the Code

Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, BYD, and others each show that Chinese firms can indeed thrive globally—but Baidu hasn’t replicated that success.

* There's Better Risk/Reward Elsewhere

Baidu trades at a discount that I initially found tempting for my own portfolio. Who doesn't want a future AI windfall? But that bet relies on overseas revenue magically materializing after a decade of tries. If you want an angle on Chinese equities, go for the companies that have already demonstrated they can succeed abroad—and leave Baidu, the “worst house on a dangerous street,” off your list.

I realize I'm probably beating a dead horse but AI is drawing striking parallels with the dot-com era. Just as the internet was once hyped to revolutionize business operations, there’s a lot of similar hype surrounding AI. The excitement is real and I do believe AI will become widespread. However, similar to the early days of the internet, it’s difficult to see a valuation that reflects the worldwide impact in the next 1-2 decade.

Let’s take Nvidia and Cisco as a comparison. Both had strong fundamentals and were leaders in selling hardware, yet after the burst, Cisco’s stock fell 80% and it took almost 20 years to recover from its peak. We've confirmed that the internet has truly revolutionized the world but why did Cisco fall so dramatically from the dot-com burst and take so long to recover?

So the question is, if the AI hype fades and GPU demand slows down or fails to materialize as expected, wouldn't Nvidia face the same fate in the early stages? How will companies profit from AI when it's just machine learning? What exactly are we anticipating? Are we just expecting AI to replace employees or, at the very least, drive down headcount to improve profit margins as a tool/service?",0,,2025-02-16,0.2732,0.7941,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.40342500000000003,0.0,0.20171250000000002,60.085625,positive

Broadcom (AVGO) has been closely examining Intel's (INTC) chip design and marketing business, the report said, but will only make a bid if it can find a partner for Intel's (INTC) manufacturing business.

TSMC (TSM), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, has studied running all of Intel's (INTC) chip plants, either as part of an investor consortium or other structure, the report said.

The discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the company seen as crucial to national security, are being led by Intel's (INTC) executive chairman Frank Yeary, the report said.

According to the report, Yeary has been telling people close to him that he is focused on maximizing value for Intel (INTC) shareholders.

President Donald Trump's administration may not support Intel's (INTC) chip plants being run by a foreign player, Reuters reported Friday. While the White House supports foreign companies investing in the U.S., it is ""unlikely"" to support a foreign entity controlling Intel's (INTC) plants.

Bloomberg had earlier reported that TSMC (TSM) was evaluating acquiring a controlling stake in Intel's (INTC) factories at Trump's request.

Any deal for Intel (INTC) would require a signoff from the U.S. government, which has poured billions of dollars into Intel (INTC) under the Chips Act of 2022. The ailing chipmaker has been the largest beneficiary of the $53 billion program, receiving up to $7.9 billion to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and other locations in the U.S.

Intel (INTC) set up its foundry business under the leadership of former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who embarked on an ambitious turnaround plan. But Gelsinger was forced out of the company last year after the board reportedly lost confidence in him.

Intel (INTC), currently valued at $102.19 billion, has tumbled nearly 65% in the last five years. In comparison, TSMC's (TSM) current market capitalization stands at $840.25 billion and Broadcom's (AVGO) at $1.09 trillion.",0,,2025-02-16,0.0,0.9552,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.2388,0.0,0.1194,55.97,positive

Their owner Ken Griffen is politically connected and he likely knows about something HUGE in the works. On DJT’s recent earnings they said they’re looking for mergers and acquisition target. This could be foreshadowing a highly beneficial acquisition/merger in the works using their $800 million cash on hand. 

There are SO many amazing opportunities that DJT can go into. A merger or partial ownership on Tik tok would be most beneficial. DJT has a huge advantage in a tik tok acquisition since it’s directly connected to the president and the acquisition is being negotiated by the president. Perhaps they could merge with X or Rumble? Those are just a few ideas off the top of my head. 

People LOVE to argue about the low revenues of DJT, but they completely overlook the $800 million in cash on hand which can easily be transformed into sweeping revenue with a savvy merger or acquisition.

It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.

At 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.

Much like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.

The market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.

# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.

In North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.

Apple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.

That’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.

Apple is winning some battles, but at what cost?

* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.
* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.
* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.
* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.

The big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.

# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.

Apple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.

But Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.

* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.
* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.
* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.

The App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.

Investors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.

# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.

Apple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.

* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.
* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.
* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.

Meanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.

# When Does Apple Become a Buy?

Apple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:

* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.
* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.
* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.

Apple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates Apple is a weaker equity than people might think —Apple’s future growth relies on price-sensitive markets where it lacks its usual pricing power, while services, its high-margin growth driver, faces regulatory threats. Without a new major revenue stream, growth looks constrained. Management has a strong track record of launching successful businesses, but at 33x forward earnings believing they’ll pull something new out of the hat requires a leap of faith.",0,,2025-02-15,0.7414,0.9987,0.0,0.5796997547149658,0.75,0.25,0.8057249999999999,0.14492493867874146,0.4753249693393707,73.76624846696853,positive

When a hedge fund enters a stock, the price may spike in the short term due to a surge in bidding. We saw with GameStop that retail investors(gamblers), with enough capital, can also sustain elevated prices.

For example, a few hedge fund managers could inject significant capital into a micro-cap stock (where less money is needed to move the price) in the same time. By executing large bids within a short timeframe, they drive up the stock price. The key issue then becomes liquidity—how easy is it to exit the position once the stock is pumped? And how thin is trade margin( if we bumped the stock, then it will surge for the same amount when we sells it. **For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction**) 

How difficult is it to pull off this kind of specularity? Do you think there's a formula to calculate liquidity, the optimal trade size, and the time required for such a strategy?

Here a short summary of the most important points: 

1. Fundamentals are bad at the moment, but the price is around the book value of the company. Government support makes it going bust unlikely. 

2. The 18A process has shown preliminary results that suggest a better performance than the comparable 2nm process from TSMC (albeit this is due to the lower transistor density), thus technologically INTC is breaking even in the realm of high efficiency chips. 

3. Board is doing one shit after the other, but finally there are signs that this is about to change

4. Major pressure by the government for US tech companies to look into switching orders to INTC could be a catalyst for a spike in profitability

While there is no guarantee that any of points 2-4 will work out, if they do we will see the stock price gain upwards of 100% in the next two years. 

If only one out of the 3 turns out to be true, the performance will probably match the market. This still makes INTC a great opportunity right now, and I have personally invested 10% of my net worth into it.

stocks,How Musk is using TSLA as a piggy bank,1iq3s4q,Counterakt,2025-02-15 10:30:23,1033,0.79,348,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iq3s4q/how_musk_is_using_tsla_as_a_piggy_bank/,"Everyone knows it is a meme stock. By definition it would crash at some point. The trick is to make money while not ending up being the bag holder when it crashes.

But the stock won’t crash unless Musk starts selling. And he knows it too. So he is using the meme stock and meme coins as collateral to invest in real companies that actually have some realistic valuation. 

Musk sold $8.5 billion in Tesla shares to buy Twitter. The stock went down. He basically converted the meme stock to a real company. The banks underwrote that investment suffered losses but he used Twitter to buy the presidency. The banks lost money but gained favors like less regulations instead. Everyone is happy.

He contracts out TSLA stuff to his private companies like xAi.  XAi and Optimus have huge conflicts of interest. Both of them need the best AI talents. My guess is Optimus will end up being the hardware side of the business(nuts and bolts assembly) while the software and IPs will belong to XAi. And for every robot sold, there will be a license paid to XAi. If the board removes Musk, the licensing fee will go up making TSLA side of the business virtually worthless.

I am pretty sure the big investment banks know these things but they are given investment opportunities in his private businesses in exchange for their silence and their inflated analyst valuations. And they don’t want to shoot themselves in the foot having lent him huge sums of money.

People say Musk won’t let TSLA down because most of his wealth is tied to it. At this point he is milking TSLA for what it is worth. He is borrowing against inflated meme stock prices to buy real companies that are private. He is hedging against the inevitable TSLA crash. His lenders are going with the Ponzi scheme to mitigate the risk to their massive investment. Having borrowed heavily against TSLA shares Musk has no incentive to work for TSLA anymore.

If I have sizable TSLA holdings I would be nervously watching his latest  and totally random OpenAI cash offer of $98 billion or a potential tik tok bid. That means the stock will crater again if he sells stock, he may not care because by now he knows the game is up. Maybe it is triggered by BYD offering free FSD on 20k cars. And this time there might be no coming back. He might offer you first dibs on SpaceX ipo for holding worthless TSLA shares but it sure won’t be cheap.

Disclosure: I don’t have any positions on TSLA at this point.

My thought process is as follows (again, only considering non-dividend stocks): 

The only thing moving the needle is speculation. If AAPL made 1bil more than expected, the stock doesn’t move until the information is available and people start speciation whether it’s good to buy/sell this information. 

Since all the money is just a pooled from the traders, it’s zero sum? It’s not a zero sum wager (winning from another’s loss) but it certainly sounds like zero sum 

Say a stock has 10 investors each having $100 invested. The moment 1/2 of them cash out, the other 1/2 would be left with $50 each, cuz money got taken from the pool and no new money came in

Anyone Else?,1iprnuo,theinkdon,2025-02-14 21:34:47,0,0.42,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iprnuo/how_i_pick_stocks_anyone_else/,"For stock selection I just look at charts: going up is good, going down is bad. Add in that you've at least heard of the company. And that it's relatively big.  

Walmart is my benchmark these days.  Have a look at its [1-year & 5-year charts](https://imgur.com/a/gHcW2K8).  Up and to the right.  And smooth.  That's my kind of stock.  

How do you find them?  By looking at a bunch of charts.  Just qualitatively, like a 5th grader would.  Is it going up, and is it smooth over, say, a year?

One way to find them is to look at the best-performing S&P500 sectors, then find the best-performing stocks within those sectors.  

If you don't know of a way to do that, here's one:  
Go to Barchart.com.  
Click on ""Stocks"" at the upper left.  
In the dropdown, far right column, under Sectors, click ""Stock Market Sectors.""  
Sort of in the upper left, in the dropdown box, change ""Today"" to ""1-year.""  
The top sector is ""Communication Services,"" up 35.2% over the last year. Click on it.  
Scroll down the page until you see the list of stock symbols.  
At the upper right of that list in blue it says ""flipcharts."" Click it.   
You might need a free membership, so sign up for that.  

Now click ""flipcharts,"" and you're looking at a candlestick 6-month view of one of the 20-odd stocks in that group.  
Upper left, change the time frame to 1Y.  
Upper right, change Template to Line Chart, Percent.  
(I don't like the candlestick view, but keep that if you want.)  

Now, *finally*, you have some charts to flip through. Only about 20, shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes your first time. You can click to the next chart at the upper right, or use the right arrow on your keyboard.  

You're just looking for charts that look like Walmart's, up and pretty smooth.  

Here's my take on the ones there today:  

CHTR, no. CMCSA, no. DIS jumped a lot in November, but isn't going up. EA, no.  

**FOX**, boom! That's what we're looking for.  
And FOXA (I don't know the difference.)  

GOOG is sort of okay, but I don't like those 3 big drops.  
LYV I mostly like.  
META seems to be taking off.  
NFLX maybe, but that big drop is scary.  
Same with T (though I got in it November 11th, and still in).  
TMUS that big drop is scary, but man, it's almost straight up since then. I'll probably get some of it Monday.  

That's it. We looked at 22 charts. When you get used to it you'll do that in 2 or 3 minutes. Note the ones you like, then study them more after this initial scan.  

That's really all there is to it. You're buying into strength, riding the trend up. But keep an eye on them, and when they start leveling off, find other ones to replace them.  

And this was just one of the S&P 500 Market Sectors. Other sectors are doing well too: Financials, Utilities, Consumer Discretionary, IT.  So scan those charts and see what you like.  

This is just finding the best-performing sectors, and then the best-performing stocks within that sector. It's very powerful.

If not, give it a try and see what you think.

The crypto exchange has a revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Circle backs its stablecoins with U.S. Treasuries and pockets the interest it earns from holding U.S. debt. Coinbase reported that it had generated $225 million from its deal with Circle in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

The crypto exchange also reported almost $215 million in revenue from “blockchain rewards.” This refers to the money Coinbase earns through staking, or when companies or individuals put crypto they own into escrow to secure a blockchain. In return for locking up their crypto, stakers receive interest. 

In Coinbase’s case, that interest from staking represented almost 10% of its fourth-quarter returns.Stablecoins and blockchain rewards

\---------------------------------

My understanding is that if i own the crypto, i stake it and i get the reward. So, is it same for coinbase ? does it own crypto and stake it ? Or is it simply taking the crypto in its centralized exchanges (which means crypto owned by others/users) staking it and earning rewards for itself - that would be crazy as users should get it instead, isn't it? or can someone who understands it explain it ?

All I can really find is privately held companies. 

A good majority of people (Americans at least) just call it quits on teeth after years of neglect and/or not understanding the impact our high sugar diets have on them. I personally have just opted to have a few teeth pulled as the cost for keeping them didn't make sense. As a middle class American this is pretty par for course. We love our teeth but the math just doesn't make sense. 

My interest here is two fold. The majority of my country goes almost our entire beginning years of life (lets say upwards to 20 years old) almost completely neglecting our dental health. By the time we start focusing on it we're basically screwed. I also don't see a big focus on this industry by anyone for whatever reason. I think the lack of this interest will lead to tremendous gains for the few investors that put money into the small amount of companies focused on tooth regeneration.

>

>Trump’s team raised the idea of a deal between the two companies in recent meetings with officials from the Taiwanese chipmaker, the person said, and TSMC was receptive. It’s unclear whether Intel is open to a transaction.

>

>The talks are in very early stages, and the exact structure of a potential partnership hasn’t been established. But the intended result would have the world’s largest made-to-order chipmaker fully operating Intel’s US semiconductor factories, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the conversations are private. It also would address concerns about Intel’s deteriorating financial state, which has forced the company to slash jobs and curb its global expansion plans.

>

>The arrangement may involve having major American chip designers take equity stakes, according to the person, along with support from the US government. That means the venture wouldn’t solely be owned by a foreign company. TSMC is the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp. and other companies developing semiconductors that power AI algorithms.

>

>TSMC and Santa Clara, California-based Intel declined to comment. A White House representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Intel shares pared losses on Friday after Bloomberg reported on the discussions. The stock was down less than 1% to $24 as 1:56 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as 5.3% earlier in the session.

>

>While Intel has lost a lot of ground to rivals over the last five years, it still manufactures the most widely used components in the personal computer and server industries. And it has the largest and most advanced production network owned by a US-based company. Those factories have taken on vital strategic importance as Washington works to reverse decades of semiconductor manufacturing shifting to Asia.

>

>Under former Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel embarked on an ambitious and expensive plan to restore its chipmaking lead, and the company won $7.9 billion in US government funding to support projects in four states. It’s also secured $3 billion to produce chips for the US military, all of which will be paid out over time as Intel’s plants hit key milestones. The company has received $2.2 billion as of January.

>

>But that effort has so far failed to attract enough outside customers to make the investments worthwhile, particularly at a new site in Ohio. Intel’s own products also are losing market share, adding to the overall squeeze on its finances — just when it needs to spend heavily. Gelsinger was forced out in December after the board lost confidence in his turnaround plans.

>

>Though Intel has reiterated its commitment to investing in US factories — even as it pulls back from efforts abroad — Washington officials have for months been discussing contingency plans. One option favored by some in the Biden administration was a possible deal between Intel and GlobalFoundries Inc., Bloomberg has reported.

>

>That would have married a maker of older-generation chips with Intel’s leading-edge business. But GlobalFoundries walked away from cutting-edge production years ago and doesn’t have the money for an acquisition, so those conversations didn’t progress much past a thought exercise.

>

>Biden officials also floated the possibility of TSMC licensing its manufacturing technology for use at Intel’s facilities, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations. But TSMC wasn’t interested in an arrangement that could ultimately benefit a competitor, the people said. And Biden’s team was generally reluctant to take an active role in deal conversations, according to several people familiar with the situation.

>

>Trump, meanwhile, is not shy about cutting deals — and TSMC, which just held its board meeting in the US for the first time, is eager to maintain good relations with the new president.

>

>Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” the US chip industry and threatened tariffs on foreign-produced semiconductors. He’s expressed a preference for using those kinds of levies to boost US chipmaking instead of government subsidies — the approach adopted by the US Chips and Science Act. That legislation, passed in 2022, led to TSMC winning $6.6 billion in grants to support three plants in Phoenix.

>

>

>But it was also Trump’s first administration that set out to lure TSMC to the US, and top Trump officials have consistently affirmed their commitment to boosting domestic manufacturing. That’s particularly true for technologies at the heart of the US-China competition.

>

>The US “will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American-designed and manufactured chips,” Vice President JD Vance said during an AI summit in Paris earlier this week.

>

>The fact that TSMC is open to an Intel deal indicates a change in tune from just a few months ago. In October, CEO C.C. Wei had told analysts that his company wasn’t interested in acquiring Intel’s factories.

>

>Asked the same question again in January, Wei didn’t directly answer: “They are our very good customers,” he said. “I like them and they are very important to TSMC’s business also. That all I can say.”

Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) has been on an absolute tear lately, closing at $59.18 after a 27% single-day gain. But what’s really catching my attention is the massive short interest—32.94% of the float is shorted. With earnings coming up on February 24, could we be looking at a potential short squeeze?

🔍 The Setup: Why HIMS Could See More Upside
	•	Short Interest: 32.94% of the float is short—this is extremely high.
	•	Days to Cover: 3.7 days—If a squeeze happens, it could escalate fast.
	•	Momentum is Strong: +27% in a single day means the stock is already attracting buyers.
	•	Earnings on Feb 24: If HIMS beats expectations, shorts could be forced to cover, accelerating an upward move.

This stock has the classic setup for a major move higher if catalysts align.

🛑 Why Are Shorts Betting Against HIMS?

1️⃣ Valuation Concerns – After a big rally, some believe HIMS is overvalued.
2️⃣ Profitability Questions – While revenue growth is strong, it’s still working toward sustained profitability.
3️⃣ Competition – Giants like Amazon and Teladoc are expanding in the space.
4️⃣ Recent Run-Up – Some traders may be expecting a pullback after the massive surge.

However, these same shorts could be fuel for a squeeze if sentiment stays bullish.

🔥 Bullish Case: Could HIMS Hit $100?

🚀 Shorts Are Stuck – If earnings beat expectations, covering could push the stock much higher.
🚀 Retail Interest Is Growing – Increased trading volume could indicate more retail momentum.
🚀 Breakout Levels – If HIMS clears $65-$70, technical traders could pile in.
🚀 Telehealth Growth – Long-term, HIMS is expanding its subscription model and increasing its customer base.

💰 My Position & Dilemma

I currently hold 1,000 shares and am up $52K from an initial $8K investment. Now, I’m debating my next move:
1️⃣ Hold for the potential squeeze?
2️⃣ Take some profits before earnings and reduce risk?
3️⃣ Reinvest into call options for higher leverage?

📊 Final Thoughts – What’s Next for HIMS?

HIMS is one of the highest shorted stocks in the market, has earnings as a major catalyst, and has strong momentum going into the event. If the company delivers strong guidance and beats earnings, we could see $80+ or even $100 in the coming weeks.

stocks,Meta plans major investment into AI-powered humanoid robots,1ipetzp,_hiddenscout,2025-02-14 11:44:21,114,0.86,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ipetzp/meta_plans_major_investment_into_aipowered/,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html)

Meta Platforms Inc., after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.

The company is making a significant investment into the category — futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks — and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn’t been announced.

Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesn’t plan to build a Meta-branded robot — something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.’s Optimus — but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.

The humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.’s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

“The core technologies we’ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,” Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the company’s advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.

Meta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta’s advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.

“We believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,” Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.

Meta’s goal is to provide what Google’s Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.’s chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.

The software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.

Meta has been investing billions of dollars for years into its Reality Labs hardware division, which sells products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses.

American Express wouldn’t be affected as it doesn’t need any AI investment to pay off for it to make revenue. They still rake in cash from their credit business and their cards are still popular among younger people because of the status of having one.

Yes, the trends is for the price to grow, but it may take 5 years to go, for example, from $50 to $52.

My point is, I want to eventually reach a point where I make around $6,000 a year in dividends from a single company that offers 3,5-4% dividends.

The company in question is Shell. The company has diversified investments and is future-proof, stable and well established, so there is no risk of bankruptcy under normal market conditions.

The risk I'm taking, is that dividends could be cut, and there won't be any money coming to me because the stock price grows very slowly.

So, under normal market conditions, in the absence of global pandemics, wars and disruptive events, what could make Shell cut dividends? What usually makes a company to cut dividends under normal market conditions while there is good profitability?

Also, if you think Shell is not a good option, you can recommend me a better company. I'm in the EU, so better recommend me EU-based companies because the US has a witholding tax for foreign investors.

Consumers sharply curtailed their spending in January, indicating a potential weakening in economic growth ahead, according to a Commerce Department report Friday.

Retail sales slipped 0.9% for the month from an upwardly revised 0.7% gain in December, even worse than the Dow Jones estimate for a 0.2% decline. The sales totals are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation for a month in which prices rose 0.5%.


Excluding autos, prices fell 0.4%, also well off the consensus forecast for a 0.3% increase. A “control” measure that strips out several nonessential categories and figures directly into calculations for gross domestic product fell 0.8% after an upwardly revised increase of 0.8%.

With consumer spending making up about two-thirds of all economic activity in the U.S., the sales numbers indicate a potential weakening in growth for the first quarter.

Receipts at sporting goods, music and book stores tumbled 4.6% on the month, while online outlets reported a 1.9% decline and motor vehicles and parts spending dropped 2.8%. Gas stations along with food and drinking establishments both reported 0.9% increases.

# Key Highlights:

* **Transaction revenue:** $1.56B (up **270% QoQ**)
* **Total revenue:** $2.3B (**vs. $1.84B expected**)
* **Earnings per share (EPS):** $4.68 (**vs. $2.11 expected**)
* **Stock performance:** Shares reached a **three-year high** of $349.75 in December and are currently around $304 (+112% YoY).

# Market Drivers:

* Bitcoin surpassed **$100,000** in Q4, contributing to a surge in trading volume.
* Political shifts played a role, as the **reelection of Trump** has led to expectations of a more **favorable regulatory environment** for crypto.
* Coinbase is engaged in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC, but recent court rulings and potential regulatory leadership changes (such as the appointment of **Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto former SEC commissioner**) may signal a shift in policy.

# Beyond Trading Revenue:

While transaction fees remain Coinbase’s primary revenue driver, the company is expanding its **subscription and services segment**, particularly through **USDC stablecoin reserves**.

* **USDC revenue:** $226M (down slightly from $246M QoQ, but up from $172M YoY).
* Coinbase holds an **equity stake in Circle** and is working to expand USDC’s market share.
* Current USDC market cap: **$56B** (compared to Tether’s **$142B**).

# Looking Ahead:

* **Can Coinbase sustain this momentum?** While Q4 revenue was up **141% YoY**, it remains below the **2021 peak of $2.5B in Q4** during the last major bull run.
* **Regulatory clarity** could be a major factor in long-term performance. The SEC’s stance on crypto has been a headwind, but new leadership and recent legal challenges could alter the landscape.
* **Valuation concerns:** With COIN’s stock up over **100% YoY**, some investors may see it as overextended. Others argue that increased crypto adoption and improved regulatory certainty could justify further upside.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

See if there is any hole in this theory. 

Please Note:I like short sellers, they keep us honest else we will be blowing bubbles all the time. They are very important aspect of the financial markets.

Right now the new govt(USA) is doing lots of big changes including weekly tariff dramas. If the market was to go down right now it will be a very bad look. The admin is close with big wall street folks. Simple message to hedge funds is to not short the market until all clear is given.

The govt along with SEC has huge powers to make short sellers life hell, like banning short selling or causing squeeze with positive announcements. Blaming short sellers for economic crisis and congressional hearings can be nightmare too. So, IMO, if the govt tells wall street to not short big time, they will definitely listen.

So, IMO, market going down due to hedge funds shorting bit time is a low probability.

That said, market can go down due to numerous other factors, which are not known at the moment, but this time around hedge funds will not aggravate the situations by piling on and sending stock big time down. Which means we may get 4-5% down and then markets will recover due to dip buying.

That means, we can all relax and ride this train as far as it wants to go. Valuations does not matter if people are buying automatically every month(payroll) and current owners like me are happy with our holding until the story changes.

That said, I will be shocked if markets are 15% higher at the end of the year because I am not expecting EPS to increase that much by then(SPY TTM EPS is still below 2021 peak, but we are 25% higher).",0,,2025-02-14,-0.3818,0.8316,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,-0.07844999999999999,0.0,-0.039224999999999996,48.03875,neutral

Here’s how the company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 73 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $2.48 billion vs. $2.42 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from $2.22 billion during the same period last year. Airbnb reported net income of $461 million, or 73 cents per share. A year ago, Airbnb reported a loss of $349 million, or a loss of 55 cents per share.

In the first quarter, Airbnb expects to report revenue between $2.23 billion and $2.27 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.3 billion for the period, according to LSEG. Airbnb said its first quarter of 2024 benefited from both Easter and an extra day in February.

Airbnb also said adjusted profit for the fourth quarter was $765 million, up 4% year over year. Analysts were expecting $653.5 million, according to StreetAccount.

In a letter to shareholders, the company said it has rebuilt its technology stack and rolled out new product updates in recent years that are driving higher conversion rates. The company also teased new offerings that it will launch in May, though it did not disclose additional details. 

“Airbnb is a fundamentally stronger company today than it was several years ago,” the letter said. “We’re continuing to build on this momentum in 2025, executing a multi-year strategy to perfect the core service, accelerate growth in global markets, and launch and scale new offerings.”

The company reported 111 million nights and experiences booked, up 12% from a year ago and above the 108.7 million expected by StreetAccount. Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to report host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $17.6 billion in the fourth quarter. That is above the $17.2 billion expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said Airbnb.org, a nonprofit founded by the company, has housed more than 19,000 people and 2,300 pets following the devastating wildfires that broke out in Los Angeles last month. The nonprofit has pledged to offer 100,000 free nights and has received $27 million in donations, including $18 million from Airbnb and its founders.

The company said it has more than five million hosts and eight million active listings around the world. Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $158 in the fourth quarter, the company said.

Airbnb shares were up about 7% for the year before Thursday’s report, topping the Nasdaq, which has gained more than 3%.

stocks,Buy/Sell/Hold SPOT - Is it overvalued?,1iotkrl,Historical_Air_8997,2025-02-13 16:06:24,11,0.74,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iotkrl/buysellhold_spot_is_it_overvalued/,"I've been bullish on SPOT for years, started buying at $73 in 2022 and DCA'd up to a cost basis of $120, so I've done well so far but is my original thesis playing out and still intact?

**OG Thesis:**

My original thesis, shortened so we can focus on today and the future: The majority of Spotify users are ad tier (at the time around 60%), but they made up less than 15% of revenue. Spotify was focused on growing MAUs instead of real monetization, but once the MAU growth starts to slow they will pivot more into monetization. I'm not concerned about more ads scaring away users, some will go to Subscriber tier and the others weren't profitable anyway, since Spotify's expenses are somewhat tied to how many listens they get having less listeners that aren't profitable isn't necessarily bad. Additionally, Spotify started getting into podcasts and I saw that being a driver of future growth. Lastly, I think they have pricing power on subscriptions. 



**Past Performance:**

So how has Spotify done over the last 2 years (from Q2 22 to Q4 24)?

|\#'s in Thousands|Q2 2022|Q4 2024|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|MAUs|433|678|54.3%|
|Revenue|2,864|4,242|48.1%|
|Net Income|(125)|367|393.6%|
|Free Cash flow|37|877|2,270.3%|

Key factors tying to my thesis: 2022 Ad tier MAU was 59.12% and contributed to 12.52% of revenue. In 2024 it was 62.96% and 12.66% respectively.

  
My thoughts based on my original thesis: I did expect Ad tier MAU to begin to contribute more to revenue by now, especially with being an even larger percent of MAU. I like to invest thinking 5 years ahead minimum, so at the time I was thinking by 2027 Ad tier should contribute to 30% of revenue (while maintaining around the 60% of MAU area), there is time left for them to get to the 30% area I wanted to see but I did expect to see SOME improvement. Spotify is also still growing MAU at >10% so I will give some slack in not fully monetizing yet. Spotify has done 2-3 Sub tier price increases with another one announced, so I was right they have pricing power (I wish they used it more on ad tier than loyal Subscribers tho). I am happy with their podcast growth, thankful they realized to cut their podcast spending though. 

  
Overall thoughts: Clearly Spotify figured out the cost cutting and improved FCF and net income at a very healthy clip. I'm also generally happy with the MAU growth but slightly disappointed in Revenue growth. Back to the Ad tier not carrying their weight there. I'm also very pleased with the introduction of audiobooks and video integration. Both I think can be growth drivers with video having huge potential. Personally, as a user, I think they are pricing audiobooks too aggressively for it to do as well as it can.

  
**Spotify's future:**

I did my own rough estimates for their MAU, revenue, and FCF in 10 years. Then I did an estimate using Spotify's target 1B MAU by 2030 and expanding growth another 5 years.

My method:

I used 4%/yr MAU growth (Subs growing 6% and Ad 2.5%). I won't bore you with too much info, but I made 6 revenue estimates using varying growth of Rev/MAU for Ad and Sub tier. Then I estimated each estimates FCF using 15% (current rate), 20% and 25%. 

**M1**

|In thousands|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|29,028|92,227|
|**Free Cash Flow**|5,854|23,057|

  
Now using Spotifys estimate of 1B MAU by 2030 then 5%/yr to 2035. I used the same method for revenue and FCF estimates.

**M2**

|In thousands|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|47,964|118,578|
|**Free Cash Flow**|7,195|29,681|

 My minimum revenue estimates used 3%/yr growth rev/MAU for both Ad and Sub tier. My max uses 8% for subs and 31% for ad tier BUT with a 10% cut to ad tier MAU to account for upset users. Figures based on average yearly revenue per user, See below:

|Tier|FY 2024 Average|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ad|56|75|120|
|Subscriber|5|7|75|

  
**Valuation:**

I like reverse DCF calcs to find what todays valuation should be. For my estimates I used 4% terminal growth and 11% Discount rate. For estimates with Spotify MAU growth I used 3% terminal and 11% Discount rate, with the faster growth I expect less runway for the terminal growth. I will show my RDCF valuations for the Average and Max FCF estimates, not the minimum since it is absolutely overvalued if it doesn't surpass min estimates. 

Price today: **$647.66**

|Average M1|Max M1|Average M2|Max M2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|548.26|841.90|638.41|958.93|
|(15.35%)|30.50%|\-1.13%|48.17%|



**Final Thoughts:**

As the valuations show, Spotify has upside if they surpass some pretty hefty targets. But even hitting my average estimates doesn't give much upside at the current price, M2 average assumes 23.5% FCF growth for 10 yrs which is no joke. I'm still bullish on the company, but I'm **Holding** for now with buying as an option on a 12%+ dip from current prices. 

**Thesis going forward:**

My original thesis is mostly still in play. I see a future where monetizing the ad tier can lead to significant growth.  Podcasts, audiobooks and video have huge potential and can drive growth the hit my highest estimates. Podcasts and audiobooks gives support to price increases and better advertising opportunities while also having higher potential margins due to less royalties. Video can drive more streaming hours and grab some market share from Youtube or other streamers. Spotify is integrating it slowly and they didn't mention tapping into a youtube-like video platform but if they can successfully pull it off any market share gain will lead to better than expected growth. 

For me to buy more I will like to see video progress and/or higher ad RPU or achieving 15%+ Subscriber growth. At current valuations I don't see a way to justify the valuation with less than 25% of revenue coming from Ad tier. It just isn't sustainable to raise subscription prices enough to justify the valuation, which is why 15%+ growth here could sway me to buy.

Selling would involve losing MAU without significantly increasing ad tier RPU, stagnant MAU and RPU growth, or ad tier growing higher than 65% without contributing more than 15% of revenue. I'd probably sell some if it increases above $730, it'd be my first 10-bagger and over-priced for me. So I'd want to lock in that kind of gain and buy again at a better valuation.",0,,2025-02-13,0.0,0.9993,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.249825,0.0,0.1249125,56.245625,positive

Inflation is persisting, and rates are looking less likely to get cut. A number of major employers have went through rounds of layoffs. Tariffs threaten to increase prices and compress margins further. And war in the Middle East looks to be picking up steam instead of winding down. 


Between how hot the market has been and all of the volatility that appears ahead, I’ve continued my strategy of pruning investments and selling covered calls on select positions. Today I sold a covered call on VOO with a strike of $615 and expiration of 01/26. My VOO is up 20% in less than a year and getting to the strike would be an additional 10% gain. 


I’m not suggesting this is the right move for everyone, but as I weigh my risk tolerance against my uncertainty in the market stability and U.S. economy, I feel more comfortable repositioning and reducing some of my exposure.


Wanted to put that out there and get responses from the community on what you expect for 2025 and how you’re positioning. 



Edit: to clear up some repeating comments



If you are reading politics into this post, that is 100% on you. We’re here to talk about the market, so be mature and try to do just that 



I do not think I’m Michael Burry. I’m not trying to beat the market, or time the market. I am actually trying to remove any element of timing by ensuring I am liquid enough to last through worst case scenario without touching my portfolio should the market take a big hit.



I’m in a position where I don’t have to touch my taxable brokerage. To ensure I can keep it that way should serious economic downturn hit, I have locked in profits to build my cash position. I’ve done this both by selling certain profitable positions and by selling CCs on profitable positions. The point of selling CCs is to lock in profit, nothing more. Yes this caps upside. That is ok



No matter what the market does, I continue contributing to my retirement accounts. If the market keeps running, good for my retirement. If it crashes, I’m prepared. This is how I handle my risk tolerance, by balancing what I leave in equities with what I have in cash



Edit 2: I’m happy to see different opinions and value everyone expressing their strategies and what they think makes sense for their portfolios. It’s why I post here.

stocks,iPhone SE 4: Apple Confirms New Product Launch Date Just Days Away,1iopt8y,Equivalent_Baker_773,2025-02-13 13:27:04,81,0.86,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iopt8y/iphone_se_4_apple_confirms_new_product_launch/,"

Apple has confirmed a new product launch for Wednesday, February 19, with CEO Tim Cook posting a cryptic teaser on X: “Get ready to meet the newest member of the family.” While Apple hasn’t explicitly mentioned the iPhone SE 4, speculation is strong that this will be the long-awaited update to the SE lineup, last refreshed in 2022. The teaser featured an Apple logo with a liquid metal look, which some believe could hint at another product like an iPad or MacBook, but industry insiders are confident it’s the new iPhone.

If the iPhone SE 4 is indeed the product being unveiled, Apple is expected to follow its typical launch schedule. Pre-orders will likely start on Friday, February 21, with reviews appearing around February 26 or 27 once the media embargo lifts. The official release is predicted for Friday, February 28, when customers will be able to purchase the device in stores and online. While details about the phone’s name, design, and pricing remain unconfirmed, Apple is expected to reveal everything through an announcement on its Newsroom website rather than a live event.

This timeline aligns with earlier leaks from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who initially predicted the SE 4 would launch this week before revising his estimate. While Apple’s teaser leaves room for speculation, the consensus is that an affordable iPhone refresh is imminent, bringing a new option for budget-conscious users who want Apple’s latest technology at a lower price point. More details will emerge soon, and if anything changes, updates are expected to follow.

**Ticker:** [**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**/** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**/** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d) **/** [**FXI** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)

**Technicals:** Nothing to do but wait until 1 PM.

**Catalyst:** Trump said that he promises reciprocal tariffs today. This will likely be on China because they are the only country left of the three (Canada/Mexico). He stated he'll give details at 1 PM on Truth Social.

**Risks:** More volatility near that time, going to position accordingly depending on the context of the tweet, but likely will be trading VXX unless something very context specific.

**Ticker:** [**DDOG (Datadog, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DDOG&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Earnings with an EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.43 expected. Revenue of $738M vs. $714.5M expected.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in this unless we break $130 after the open.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cloud security sector is overall growing due to enterprise adoption, but DDOG cited $3.185B vs $3.24B of revenue guidance, slightly lower than expected.

**Risks:** More tariffs, rising/flat interest rates when we expected them to be cut, mostly macro factors when faced with more technology spending.

**Related Tickers:** S, CRWD

**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Baidu announced that its AI chatbot, Ernie Bot, will be available for free starting April 1, citing advancements in technology and reduced costs.

**Technicals:** Had a decent spike premarket, will be watching if this breaks $100 or not.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** AI is getting cheaper and cheaper; this is a decision similar to DeepSeek to attract users. Will be testing capabilities personally to see how it goes. These competitors are rising to meet OpenAI mainly in price, (can you really get better than free?) and are content with being ""second-best"" as long as customers can save in price and they can save in training costs. Ultimately, I see it as a viable strategy because the average white-collar worker doesn't need the highest performing LLMs.

**Ticker:** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** HOOD reported EPS of $1.01 vs 0.44. Revenue reached $1.01B vs $934M.

**Technicals:** Overall a blowout, watching the $65 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Resurgence in retail trading activity, particularly in cryptocurrencies. Also cited election betting as a major revenue factor. Also announced three major events - new advisory features, crypto events, and the 'HOOD Summit' from the past.

**Risks:** The company's growth is mainly being driven by crypto, which may be curbed by the SEC (but Gensler is gone so I doubt it).

**Technicals:** Overall the earnings were good - I have no idea why it fell. Also seems like the market agrees; it's recovered some of the move. The only thing I can find was Reddit's daily active users was 101.7M, slightly below expectations of 103.24M.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Reddit cited that their Trends Feature has significant interest from advertisers, but beyond that still not 100% sure as to why the drop.

stocks,Apple’s Stock-Market Performance Is Increasingly Made in China,1iojaoh,WinningWatchlist,2025-02-13 08:42:23,68,0.86,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iojaoh/apples_stockmarket_performance_is_increasingly/,"* Country is both a significant market and key production hub
* Apple has underperformed other Big Tech stocks this year

>Investors in America’s biggest company are increasingly focused on China, where Apple Inc. is striving to win over a crucial customer base while also facing tariff-related risks.

>The iPhone maker counts China as a significant market and a major manufacturing hub. If it improves its flagging sales in the country with artificial intelligence features in its devices, that could be a key catalyst to revive the investment case. On the other hand, tariffs and the prospect of an escalating trade war represent risks of unknown magnitude.

>Read: Apple’s China Focus Thrusts It Into Center of Geopolitical Fight

>“Apple’s level of exposure to China is a risk relative to much of the rest of the market,” said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. The prospect of Apple being in the crosshairs of tariffs or investigations should be on investors’ radars, he said.

>“However, if AI iPhones are a success, that could mean steady growth over the next several years,” he added.

>The shares are down 5.4% in 2025, making Apple the worst performer among the Magnificent 7 except for Tesla Inc. Sentiment has soured in recent months, with tepid demand for the iPhone 16 — the first to incorporate AI features — and tariff risks weighing. The company’s recent results were mixed, featuring disappointing China and iPhone sales, though the forecast was seen as encouraging.

>Improving China sales would be significant. Apple got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with about 26% for Europe and more than 40% for the Americas.

>The potential for improved trends in China was demonstrated this week, when Apple jumped on a broadly negative day for markets following a report that it has started working with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to bring AI features to Apple products in China. The Chinese firm’s chairman confirmed the partnership on Thursday.

>“We would view this as a critical catalyst for Apple’s competitive standing in China,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote earlier this week. Citing a survey the firm conducted, he added that Chinese iPhone users are more interested in AI than US or European peers, and that more than 50% said the staggered roll out of Apple Intelligence had “a moderate to significant impact on their decision not to upgrade to a new iPhone this cycle.”

>Any improvement would also come after a period of muted growth compared with Big Tech peers. Apple’s revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.9% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.6% pace expected for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

>Within this context, geopolitical tensions loom large. The Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs against China, and the country retaliated with tariffs of its own. China is also weighing a potential probe into Apple’s policies and App Store fees.

>Analysts are so far downplaying the risk of tariffs, though they note uncertainties like how long they might be in place and whether Apple will get an exemption. Evercore ISI sees an impact “in the range of 3-4% of EPS,” which it described as “relatively minimal.” Bank of America said the impact on earnings should be “limited” and “manageable.”

>Still, Apple’s valuation suggests limited room for error. Shares trade at 31 times estimated earnings, roughly 50% above their average over the past decade. The stock also trades at a premium to the broader market and the overall tech sector.

>Following multiple downgrades this year, just over 60% of analysts recommend buying the stock, a rate well below megacaps like Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., or Meta Platforms Inc.

>Still, investors continue to view Apple as a relatively defensive stock given its strong cash flow, massive buyback program, high-margin services business, and a lack of heavy spending on AI.

>“Apple looks a little problematic in the short term given the valuation and the lack of growth, but you’re not going to find a more impressive cash-cow of a company,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “There’s a reason it remains an institutional and retail favorite.”

Would anyone care to defend Nike? I have the following thoughts: 

They are making an EBIT of 5-7bn yearly and a FCF of 4-6bn, with 12bn total debt (good, not too high) and a market cap of 107bn. Dividend yield is 2.08%. 

The financials indicate that revenue has peaked. And let's be honest, the market is already saturated. They are only really able to grow organically in emerging markets, or through raising prices. So there's barely an assumption of growth built into the revenue/profit/FCF. 

So why pay 107/6 = ~18x FCF/profit? They could increase margins if they significantly lowered advertising, but I don't think that's going to happen because without advertising you have a dead brand. 

I looked at Nike because it was recommended as a good dividend paying stock with growth potential, but I am only seeing a small dividend and overpriced valuation. If the dividend yield were 4% (market cap 56bn I.e. share price $40) I would say it is a good buy. 

So do you disagree, and why?  ",0,,2025-02-13,0.0,0.9698,0.6141377091407776,-0.584505021572113,0.75,0.25,0.24245,0.31447702646255493,0.2784635132312775,63.92317566156387,positive

Sony Group raised its annual earnings projections after reporting a rise in third-quarter net profit thanks to the strength in its game and music businesses.

The Japanese entertainment and electronics company said Thursday that net profit increased 2.7% from a year earlier to 373.74 billion yen, equivalent to $2.42 billion, for the three months ended December. That beat the estimate of Y290.5 billion in a poll of analysts by data provider Visible Alpha.

Third-quarter revenue grew 18% to Y4.410 trillion.

For the year ending March, it now projects net profit to climb 11% to Y1.080 trillion and revenue to increase 1.4% to Y13.200 trillion. It previously projected Y980.00 billion in net profit and Y12.710 trillion in revenue.

Sony raised its full-year operating profit forecast for its game business to Y380.0 billion from Y355.0 billion projected earlier. It also increased its annual operating profit view for its music business, expecting Y340.0 billion instead of Y330.0 billion forecast previously.

Third-quarter operating profit from its game business rose 37% to Y118.06 billion. Operating profit from its music business climbed 28% to Y97.42 billion.

Yes robotics and artificial intelligence are EVOLVING and will increase the productivity of companies.

Increasing productivity means that with lower costs ( majority is personnel costs ) = more goods produced.

Goldman Sachs says that, Robotics and AI will cause, in 2030, a global decrease of about 300.000.000 jobs.

This service is provided on the Uber Eats app as Uber holds a minority stake in Serv Robotics because Serve Robotics is a spin off from Uber. The project was originally started in the company Postmates and later became a part of Uber when Uber bought Postmates. Nvdia is also a strategic partner in this company.

The company also sells ad space on its robot. Advertisements are run on the robots body. The company is also potentially looking into selling fleets of its robots to corporations that might have a use for them. There is no contract or sale of a fleet as of now. These robots can also be used for other last mile deliveries such as parcels. At the moment, these robots only do food deliveries and run ads. These are their main sources of revenue.

The motivation behind these robots comes from the data that more than 50 percent of deliveries are within 2.5 miles from a restaurant. These robots are useful to food delivery companies as it should help them cut costs in deliveries.

The robot can travel as fast as 7 miles/hr and has a range of 37 miles. A robot averages 20-40 deliveries a day. The robot's container can hold up to 2 big bags or four large pizzas. The container is sealed and is opened via the Uber Eats app or a code that can be typed on the screen on the robot. The robot constantly provides its current location through the app. The robots go back to a hub at night and take a few hours to charge. The robot can navigate terrain by itself 80 percent of the time and requires manual control 20 percent of the time. A person manually controlling a robot can operate up to 4 robots at a time. The percentage of self navigation a robot can handle is expected to increase with new advancements in Artificial Intelligence. There is also a technician that would drive to a robot in case it needs to be fixed or brought back to a charging station. This situation hasn't been a problem that often so far.

The company had a pilot with Uber that it passed and has a contract to produce 2000 robots by the end of 2025 and have them operational on the platform.

The company has 59 daily active robots as of the quarter ending on September 30, 2024. The daily supply hours that the robots provide are 465. This comes out to 7.8 hours a day per robot.

The company rolled out their third generation robots on October 16, 2024. These robots can reach speeds roughly twice as fast, travel roughly twice as far on a single charge and spend 6 more hours in the field. The company also managed to cut the cost of producing one robot by half. The robots storage also increased by 15 percent.

**Revenue:**

In the year ending on 31 December, 2022, the company made $108,819 in revenue and in the year ending on 31 December 2023, the company made $207,545 in revenue.

In the year ending on 31 December, 2022, the company had a net loss of $21,855,127 and in the year ending on 31 December, 2023, the company had a net loss of $24,813,736.

The company has since gone to put more robots out on the field and revenue increased in subsequent quarters. The constituents of the revenue of these quarters isn't expected to stay the same. Explanation given after the numbers. The following are the numbers for the quarters ending on

March 31, 2024         - 39 daily active robots and $946,711 in revenue.

June 30, 2024           - 48 daily active robots and $468,375 in revenue.

September 30, 2024 - 59 daily active robots and $221,555 in revenue.

A big part of the revenue for the first two quarters comes from Serve Robotics providing non-exclusive software services to Magna. Magna is the company that they are using to build their fleet of 2000 robots. The software services provided were some non exclusive software that Serve made for their robots. This benefits Magna as they can use this information to produce better products.

The three quarters had $851,101, $296,035 and $38,767 in revenue respectively, from these software services provided to Magna. These numbers are not expected to go up or be a constant source of revenue.

**Future earnings guidance**: With the deployment of the 2000 robots, they are estimating their yearly run rate revenue to increase up to 60 - 80 million dollars.

**Challenges:**

The biggest challenge this company faces is the cost to produce and run the robot. Before they announced their third generation of robots, it cost $63,000 to produce a robot. They have managed to cut that cost in half.

They expect a robot to last 5-6 years. At its previous cost of $63,000, it would take one robot 4 years just to make back the amount of money put into it before the robot is not fit for service anymore. With the new cost, this number has gone down to 2 years and gives the robot more time to produce a profit. The numbers are as follows. I have picked their last quarters numbers to do this calculation. They had 59 daily active robots. Their revenue from deliveries was $112,288 and revenue from branding fees(fees they charge to run ad's) was $70,500. Their total revenue for 59 robots was $221,555. That comes out to $3755 per robot for one quarter. At their previous cost of $63,000, it would take the robot 16 quarters or 4 years to make back the money it cost to produce them. Because they have managed to cut costs by half(I am using $32,000 as a conservative estimate), it would now take them 8 quarters or 2 years to make back the money it cost to produce one robot.

These calculations don't take into account the running costs of the robots. These are the other challenges the company faces in turning a profit.

I couldn't find any numbers on how much they have to pay for their remote operators and technicians. I did email investor relations asking the following questions.

1. Has the ratio of remote operators to robots decreased? As in, can one remote operator handle more than 4 robots or not?
2. How much does it cost to have one remote operator per x many robots(whatever data they might have for x) and how much does it cost to have a field technician and if they have any data on the ratio of technician to robots.
3. Are the remote operators in America? If so, are there any plans to have these operators in countries where labour is cheap.

They haven't gotten back to me yet. I will update this post when they do.

**Catalysts to look for:**

The biggest catalysts to look for is if they can reduce their cost of producing a robot further and if they can reduce their costs of running a robot more. These two things will help tremendously in them turning a profit from these robots.

The other catalyst to look for is advancements in AI and the decrease in hardware prices. Their robots are at level 4 autonomy and with more advancements in AI, they can bring their robots to level 5. If this were to happen, the robots would require less operators and technicians. With decreases in hardware prices, it would be cheaper for them to produce their robots.

I still have to more research on what exactly are the most important and most expensive parts needed to produce their robots. They do say that a LIDAR component is very important in the production of their robots. I don't know much about this component yet but will do more research into it.

**My comments on the stock:**

This stock is definitely very speculative. I am looking forward to their next earnings and their next 10-k, both of which are near the end of this month. I think there is potential in this company if they can manage to bring down their cost of production and running costs.

I still have to do more research and understand their financials more. They have managed to raise more money and as of September 30, 2024 they had $50.9 million in cash or cash equivalent.

The stock is trading at a market cap of roughly $1 billion dollars. I do believe that the stock is priced with high expectations for its future profitability.

stocks,Confluent Is At An Inflection Point,1io3txt,Fountainheadusa,2025-02-12 17:33:42,12,0.7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1io3txt/confluent_is_at_an_inflection_point/,"**Confluent (CFLT) $37 is still worth buying.** 

I’ve owned it for over two years but will pyramid (add smaller quantities on a large base) it further.

**Why is this company still worth investing in after a 20% post-earning bump?**

**Four important catalysts**

**Databricks partnership:** The partnership with Databricka, which is much better known and valued increases brand awareness and opens a lot of new opportunities and doors.

This could accelerate growth from the current 22-23%.

**Strong customer base:** 90% of its revenues come from 100K + ARR clients.

The $1Mn+cohort in ARR sales saw the highest growth of 23%, and Confluent managed a net ARR of 117%, indicating strong upselling.

**A Changing Data Processing Market:** The entire batch processing model could be up for grabs - customers moving at the speed of light and willing to pay for the latest technology could be a huge TAM. 

This is a paradigm shift, which Confluent has been trying to build into for a decade. 2025 might be that inflection year, with all the AI build-outs and use cases that are likely to need live processing - Confluent is the leader in that field. To be sure it's not going to throw data processing models into obsolescence, why would you spend money on data that doesn’t need to be processed in real-time, however, it could take a large chunk of that market.

**Snowflake may acquire RedPanda:** Snowflake is reportedly trying to buy streaming competitor RedPanda for about 40x sales: While it's not an obvious comparison, Red Panda is supposedly less than 10% of Confluent’s revenues but growing at 200-300%. But it's the synergy with the larger data provider that’s getting it a massive price tag - Snowflake would love to have this arrow in its quiver of data tools.

Confluent is best positioned to take advantage of the possible shift from batch processing to processing in data streaming; its founders invented Apache Kafka, the open-source model for data streaming. And while its invention is available for free - managing and maintaining it at scale needs the paid version. Over the years with the focus on Confluent Cloud, Confluent gets 90% of its $1Bn revenue from customers over $100K in annual revenue. 

Confluent has the cash, the tech chops, and the focus - sure Apache Kafka is open source and many cloud service providers like AWS and Microsoft also provide enough competition, but no one has the product breadth that Confluent does.

I would not be surprised if Confluent’s multiple expands from the current 8x sales after this earnings report.

A top Apple (AAPL) stock analyst says the consumer electronics giant is mulling whether to make a humanoid robot.

In a post on social network X on Wednesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots as part of its future smart-home ecosystem.

""These products are still in the early proof-of-concept (POC) stage internally,"" Kuo said. ""Given current progress and typical development cycles, Apple's robot mass production likely won't start until 2028 or later.""

""Interestingly, Apple has been unusually open about sharing some of its robotics research during the early POC stage — possibly to attract talent,"" he added.

Kuo cautioned that Apple is still very early in the product development cycle. The proof-of-concept stage is a ""testing ground"" used to determine whether core technologies and product ideas are viable before proceeding.

Apple's rumored foldable iPhone is also in the proof-of-concept stage, he said.

According to sources, the company plans to launch an Android app as early as Wednesday, marking a rare instance of Apple offering a core service on its rival’s platform. While Apple Music has been available on Android for years, TV+ had previously been limited to Apple devices and third-party TV platforms like Roku. The move signals Apple’s intent to compete more aggressively with Netflix and Disney+, as TV+ still lags behind major streaming services despite hits like Ted Lasso and Severance.

The expansion comes as Apple continues to refine its streaming strategy. TV+, which launched in 2019 at $4.99 per month and now costs $9.99, has never disclosed subscriber numbers, leaving its market position somewhat unclear. Alongside the new Android app, Apple will also make its MLS Season Pass available to Android users, giving soccer fans access to Major League Soccer matches. While Apple declined to comment, the move highlights its broader push to make TV+ more accessible and attract a wider audience.

Even when Tesla is selling just 6 models of Vehicles. As of February 2025, Tesla offers the following vehicle models:

1. Model S: A full-size luxury sedan known for its high performance and long range. 


2. Model 3: A mid-size sedan designed to be more affordable while maintaining performance and range.


3. Model X: A mid-size luxury SUV featuring falcon-wing doors and seating configurations for up to seven passengers.


4. Model Y: A mid-size crossover SUV available in five- and seven-passenger configurations. A redesigned version, known as the ""Juniper"" Model Y, was introduced in early 2025, featuring updated exterior and interior designs. 


5. Cybertruck: A full-sized electric pickup truck with a distinctive stainless steel exoskeleton design. Deliveries began in late 2023.


6. Semi: A Class 8 semi-truck designed for cargo transport, with initial deliveries starting in December 2022. 

Yes, Tesla will have RoboTaxis and it will be Revolutionary but Waymo is already here and working and so Alphabet should get a Trillion Dollar more for that:-


Market Capitalization:
Alphabet: Alphabet's market cap is around two Trillion dollar.
Tesla: Tesla's market cap is reported to be between one Trillion Dollar. 

Also, Elon Musk has been an Over-promise 
and unreliable of what Vision he is selling to there Shareholders that Tesla is worth a Trillion dollare. 

Tesla has several subsidiaries that contribute to its business in electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, and other technologies. Some key Tesla subsidiaries include:

1. SolarCity Corporation – Acquired by Tesla in 2016, SolarCity focuses on solar energy products, including solar panels, solar roofs, and energy storage solutions.


2. Tesla Energy Operations, Inc. – Handles Tesla’s solar and energy storage business, including Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack.


3. Tesla Motors Netherlands B.V. – A European subsidiary managing Tesla's operations in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe.


4. Tesla Shanghai Co., Ltd. – Operates Tesla’s Gigafactory in China, producing vehicles like the Model 3 and Model Y for the Asian market.


5. Tesla India Motors and Energy Pvt. Ltd. – A subsidiary established in India, primarily for future operations in the country.


6. Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. – Provides auto insurance services tailored for Tesla vehicle owners.


7. Tesla Finance LLC – Offers financing and leasing options for Tesla customers.


8. Tesla Automation GmbH – A German subsidiary specializing in manufacturing automation and robotics, previously known as Grohmann Engineering.


9. Maxwell Technologies, Inc. – Acquired in 2019, Maxwell Technologies focused on ultracapacitors and battery technology improvements.


10. Tesla Ltd. (UK) – Manages Tesla’s operations in the United Kingdom.



These subsidiaries help Tesla expand its presence in EV production, energy solutions, insurance, and automation.

I just opened a ROTH IRA and a 529 account for my 8-month-old son. My main goals are to save for his college and build up my retirement savings.

My wife is leaving her job to spend more time with our son, which means we'll be taking an income cut of about $30K per year. Even with that, I can realistically afford to contribute $100–$150 per month to my Roth IRA.

The only thing I really know about investing comes from Dave Ramsey, who recommends ""good growth stock mutual funds."" The problem is, I’m not entirely sure what that means or where to start.

Here’s my current situation. I'm 34 years old and aiming to retire at 65. My job offers a 401(k) with a 4% match, and I’m currently contributing 4%.

I’m not looking to get rich quick—just trying to play the long game so I can retire comfortably while also saving for my son’s education.

They sell slowly OTC to avoid scaring the market.

Meanwhile, they short BTC with leverage to maximize profits.

Once support breaks, they dump everything, triggering liquidations.

Bitcoin crashes below 30k, ETFs see massive outflows, and they cash in billions.


If BTC no longer grows exponentially, MicroStrategy is trapped. They either exit now with a profit or risk imploding with the asset. And if they decide to sell, we could witness the biggest Big Short in crypto history.

Some information about Poppi, the acquisition target.**

\- Founded in 2018 by a couple, they reported upwards of $100 million in sales in 2024. Even if we round up to $150 million in sales, Pepsi would be paying a 13x multiple on top line revenue not net profit. Realistically 19.5x top line revenue on the $100 million reported if we don't use the rounded up $150 million figure.

\- The company previously appeared on Shark Tank and sold 25% of the business to Rohan Oza for a $400,000 investment. Rohan Oza is a businessman known for his success in bringing drink brands such as Vita Coco and Vitaminwater to market

\- The company has a wide range of marketing partnerships with celebrities including Post Malone, Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Billie Eilish, Russell Westbrook, Jennifer Lopez and Olivia Munn

\- Poppi was previously sued in California class action lawsuit for misleading consumers about the health benefits of their drinks. With only 2g of fiber, a consumer would have to drink 4+ cans to ""realize any potential health benefits""

**Interested to hear what people think about this acquisition.**

\- Is Poppi overvalued and did Pepsi overpay?

\- Should Pepsi have built the internal capabilities to build a brand like this rather than acquiring? Does acquiring show a lack of direction and vision by management? It's hard to imagine that with Pepsi's scale in manufacturing, marketing, retail partnerships, etc. it have cost more than $1.95 billion to make a competing offering that could reach $100 million in sales within 6 years.

\- Naturally my next thought was, given the above on valuation, is the Poppi brand worth almost $2 billion? Maybe it's not the sales they are after, but the formulation, the brand, or the marketing partnerships.

\- Will Pepsi change the formula, leading to turning off long time customers?

I have a screenshot, but unable to add to this subreddit. There are two positions:

$240 Call 3/21 (sell to open)   -$12.70

$240 Call 4/4 (buy to open)   $15.25

Red lines outside the two breakevens with a huge upwards green, peaking at $240 in between breakevens.

  
Basically, the chart is reading breakevens for this option at the near-term expiration of the front month are $217 and $268 with huge profit in between those two prices. Using that chart, if the strike price is $245 at expiration this Friday, my profit would be around $500. How is this the case and how would I not lose $255? If the short call was exercised, would it not automatically exercise my long call so that the shares would be covered, leaving me at a net loss of $255? It would obviously suck since the other expiration is 4/4. I'm not sure if it is accounting for if I already owned the 100 shares. Would my first problem be that I picked a strike price further ITM?

There are different schools of thought when it comes to (active) investing, and they are not necessarily better or worse, but they have advantages and disadvantages. I could list at least 3: Value investing, trading/speculation and quantitative finance. The second one sounds unscientific but I do not discard that there can exist some skills in trading the news and placing bets on underlooked securities or assets. The third one is legit but more niche, and it is the route I am taking because of my background background it is easier for me to think on how to optimize a portfolio in terms of risk and return, using leverage, exploiting momentum, adapting to the environment depending on financial data and so on. This is something you can do in Python and I am not just naively overoptimizing backtests or building trading bots. History is my teacher because I can test what a portfolio strategy would have done in different time frames and different stock markets. 

This distinction is essential, because without it, investing advice simply doesn't make sense. Consider the following scenario: A stock you are interested in is dipping 20% today. What do you do? If the valuation of the company or their governance hasn't changed, the value investor would say you need to buy this stock. But the trader or the quant probably wouldn't do that. When you buy dips, you are buying volatility. It doesn't make sense from a risk/return perspective most of the time, because losing money hurts more than winning. When I see people buying dips, I see it no different than just gambling, unless you can give me a good argument based on fundamentals of why it is a good decision. When you look at things from this framework, it is not contradictory to be adaptable and use multiple tools that at times look contradicting. 

Similarly, I would say that ""beating the market"" means much more than just achieving a higher return than the benchmark. It matters how you get there. Because if you are getting the same return for a fraction of the volatility or drawdowns, you are already beating the market. The day you retire you will see what sequence of returns can do to your portfolio while you are withdrawing money. It can mean the difference between being able to withdraw 3% and 5%.

Delinquency credit reports are landing for 9.2 million people (**43% of Americans with payments due**), due to hitting the 90 day mark of missed payments since late 2024’s resume of credit reporting on federal student loans.  

Why is this important? Student loans are dispersed by semester, not consolidated. While 1 payment is typically made, it’s spread out to 8+ loans. Missing 1 payment (as 9.2 million, 43% have now done) shows up on credit reports as 8+ missed payments, **tanking credit scores by 130-250 points overnight** (I personally know someone who just lost 200). 

You can see stories gaining traction on here of those home/car shopping, only to see this credit hit. Does this effectively remove or significantly hinder 9 million from the borrowing economy?

It is usually during these volatile periods that a set-it-and-forget plan with no sense of asset classes will whack an individual. 

Example? I am about to turn 62 and hope to retire when I turn 65. I already have an annuity and currently drop $20,000 per year in retirement accounts and do have a decent employer contribution. We own our home 100% and now, have no dependents. I am aggressive, but not so much that I want to get crazy. Here is my allocation.

During his tenure at Soros Fund Management he brought in over a billion dollars betting on the collapse of the British pound  (Black Wednesday), he also made out like a bandit betting on the collapse of the Yen.

He started his own investment firm, Key Square Group.  which did so badly they lost a ton of investors until the economic boom under Biden. His firm was very profitable 2021-2023.  The S&P under Biden gave us + 58% or so return or so (corrected).

He recently said what the Trump stock market tank is just an ordinary cycle, and that had we not prospered so much in 2006, 2007 we would not have had the ""market correction"" of 2008.  2008 was caused by deregulation and bad loans (amongst other things).   He is gaslighting investors and all Americans

He stands to make a ton of money from an impending recession.

Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, is an investment banker and worth between 2-4 billion dollars. He is on record saying Trump tariffs are ""worth it"" if they cause a recession. He has also said it's Biden's fault if we have a recession.

Biden oversaw the best economy we have seen in 50 years.

What these men have in common is both are bullshitting investors and all Americans.  Egg prices could go to $500 a dozen and they would buy the same amount of eggs they do now and not feel a thing.  They will also profit during a recession and they will be in  a great position to buy anything they want at cheap prices.

No telling how many White House insiders are shorting the S&P and other funds.

It's important that investors scrutinize the economy as well as those who are implementing policies that are degrading the market and realize when you are being gaslighted by those will profit from investor ignorance.

Finally, you hear a lot of noise these days with mindless cliches: ""timing the market"" or ""panic selling"" from people who are so gas lit you should avoid smoking around them to avoid combustion.

Buffet is sitting on more cash in the history of BRK and for a reason, and he has clearly said tariffs are not paid by the tooth fairy (they are paid by you and I).

The best thing an investor can do right now is understand fundamental economics and recognize when you are being gaslighted.  What you are seeing is not a market correction nor an ordinary cycle.  You're witnessing a very healthy market get tanked, and on purpose.

The irony is the market tries to love Trump.  They love his deregulation, low taxes for the rich and corporations, the end of red tape, etc.  The market loved his election win and we were seeing fresh highs.

Until he started his trade wars and threats to invade, and annex foreign countries.

Finally, both Trump and Elon have said it's going to be ""painful"" for a ""while"".  It will not be painful for them.  They will feel nothing, Trump has made hundreds of millions in the last few months off of his various grifts, Elon has tanked Tesla with his Nazi antics, but it's not like he's having to go to fewer movies or tighten his budget.

In March of 2021 they came out with “*The 630× Decade: 10 Stocks for the Next Tech Revolution”.* In short, the report recommended stocks that they reasoned were uniquely positioned to take advantage of the self-driving car revolution. It was timed to coincide with a then-upcoming announcement from Tesla, in which they believed Tesla would finally unveil their full self-driving update. The potential gains, they said, reached as high as 630 times over the next decade. Of course, there was the requisite warning that there were no guarantees, and that probably not every stock would be a winner. Now, four years later, we’re not exactly at the midway point, but my personal opinion is that anywhere between four and six years is fair for a midterm review. So, here are the stocks, starting with the winners and moving downward to the losers. TLDNR version - any investor who bought and held is looking at a return of **83 cents on the dollar** today.

I tried posting it in the Robinhood sub, but the moderators rejected it. Why, I couldn't say, though I do think it's more directly relevant there, though shouldn't be too much of a stretch for this sub. 

This is specific to crypto - BCH - but that doesn't matter as the metrics are the same for stocks and crypto.

I sold off most of my BCH holdings today, so that there was only 1 coin left. That made it, IMO, really straightforward to see that there was an error in the equity calculation.

I have 1 coin. Market value of 1 coin was \~$335. Therefore my equity position was \~$335. But the platform says it's \~$282.

So, I contacted support. Started with the crypto team. They transferred me away to the stock and equities team. They reviewed it and sent it back to the crypto team.

The last agent ended up telling me that equity amount was the real average cost. We went back-and-forth a bit debating that, then it ended with the support agent ending the chat so quickly I couldn't even respond to his last message. I type \~90 WPM with 0 - 1 errors, so I know it wasn't just a fast type job, he definitely typed out the message first, then copy/pasted it in and ended the chat. Which at the end of what turned into well over an hour, was frustrating, but not the issue. It IS why I'm here checking to make sure I'm not crazy or missing anything though.

**Am I missing something? This seems so straightforward, it's a math/calculating error, right? Or a label error, because I can sell the 1 coin right now, and receive more than the $280 equity.**

I sent each one of them a screenshot showing what I was saying. Here's the three screenshots, and the conversation starting with when the third agent picked up after reviewing the chat history.

[First screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/lulvcjo3x4pe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d1b74bd67d8dc939eb808cedb518be3724f477c)

So, the third agent ""figures"" it out. Here's the conversation, my replies are in bold, their replies are italic. :

>*I am back and I appreciate you for waiting. As I take a look into your screenshot, you are seeing your equity as $283.13. To let you know, this is the amount you paid for the BCh you bought throughout the time your BCH is in your account. It will not show you the current value of crypto you hold base on the market value of the BCH since it is only the reference point of how much you paid for the crypto itself.*

>**That's not correct.**

>*That is why there is an average cost. Robinhood defines average cost as the cost per share of your current open position. It is used to calculate the unrealized profit and loss of your current position*

>**What I paid throughout the the time of my bch is the average cost**

>**The equity amount is how much my current holdings are worth**

>**and this one is worth \~333ish**

>*Check our* [*Help Center*](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/average-cost/#AverageCostandCostBasisarenotthesamething) *for more information about this.*

>**Average cost isn't the value. Because that value goes up or down depending on the price of the crypto.**

>**My average cost only goes up or down if I make a purchase**  
**I'm sorry, but what you're saying is completely wrong..**

>**The equity amount is the value of my holdings. Current holdings.**  
**I couldn't be more sure of anything in life.**

>**It's also only happening with BCH so far as I can tell**  
**Average cost wouldn't be the value of my holdings lol. Its the average COST, not value, not equity..**

>*I understand, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If that is what you believe in, I would not argue with that at all. I am only relaying the information I can see in your account. As I check here, the total equity in your screenshot matches your total cost for the BCH. Please check our Help Center to know more about the average cost.*

>**ok, maybe it matches the average cost, but it shouldn't.**  
**i did check it. Did you?**

>*I did.*

>**I sent the Robinhood definition from help center:** If you’re using an earlier app version for stocks, ETFs, and options trading, Robinhood defines Average Cost as the weighted average amount paid for shares (buys). For crypto, the average cost is the total notional value of the crypto assets you’ve purchased on Robinhood, divided by the total quantity of crypto assets you’ve acquired on the platform. For crypto, the average cost is calculated by dividing the total amount spent on purchasing that specific crypto on Robinhood (including all purchases since opening your account) by the total quantity of that crypto acquired on the platform.

>**I'm not asking about average cost. I'm asking about the equity, which is the market value. And I believe it used to be labeled market value as well.**

>**I have no question about average cost. So I'm not sure how that is supposed to answer this inquiry..**

>**You sentYeah, look at any of my other crypt holdings. That equity number = the market price x my holdings. For all of them but BCH it appears**

>*You are looking for the value of your BCH based on the value of the market correct? That is the average cost. The equity you are seeing as I have mentioned seems to be the total cost of how much you bought the said crypto. But you know what, I will just reach out to our team for more information. Maybe they can enlighten us about this. Stay on the line and I will reach out to our internal team.*

>**No it's not. That's... Well I'm not even sure how you could think that or say that. It's 100% not.**

>**Thank you for reaching out to someone else**

However, gold also surves a structural purpose in that people can park wealth in gold when other asset types are in a downturn, say, like in the 2008 crash. So gold serves as a safe haven with the promise of being able to change it back to other assets in the future. 

Bitcoins could serve the same function, but instead Bitcoins seem to track stock prices rather than be a safe haven in a market crash.

Is Bitcoins always going to be a rally asset, or will it change to behave more like gold in the future?

**EDIT**: It seems most are in agreement that Bitcoins are a joke! Anyway, this was actually meant as a serious question!

The reasoning is that if a structural benefit of Bitcoins can be determined, you can begin to speculate on what its proper total market cap should be. Right now gold is about 3% of the total, while Bitcoin is about 0.4%. But if Bitcoin becomes an essential structural asset, you might predict that its relative market cap should increase before it stabilizes.

However, if Bitcoins remain a rally yolo asset, it is hard to see its structural value. That's why I am interested in whether it might gravitate towards being a safe haven or diversifying asset instead.",0,,2025-03-16,0.6124,0.9928,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.7075,0.0,0.35375,67.6875,positive

Buffett suggests putting 90% in stocks in a low cost S&P500 tracker ETF / fund and forget about it. The market and compound growth will do the rest. Up to now, he’s been 100% right.

Third option is to invest it in a standard portfolio of global stocks, commodities and bonds (favoured by most financial advisors) but which will likely underperform the market in the long run, though with lower volatility.

At this point my international bond position is getting large enough that I'm questioning whether this is a good idea - putting it into a tax deferred account is tax efficient, but offset by reducing growth in a tax free account compared to holding stocks.

I've been thinking maybe I should just keep it simple and buy more US bonds in the 401k and switch to a stock fund in the ROTH.  I noticed Fidelity for example only holds 1.6% international bonds in the same target date, so I'm not sure there's much need to worry about this.

So I'm trying to decide between three options:
1) Keep 5% of the portfolio in international bonds in my ROTH
2) Keep 5% in international bonds but switch it to taxable
3) Redirect the 5% international bonds to US bonds in my 401k, changing that from bonds to stocks in the ROTH

I will not find a comparable job in my field at my age, jobs are rare and there is too much ageism. 

My advisor said the worst case scenario for my $ is to have to live off what I can take without penalties if the market drops significantly (e.g., recession) - I’d have to take about 10% per year, selling low, and my plan would fail. 

Also, I am at 70% stock, so fairly exposed - have already lost 8% in the past month. 

He suggests protecting the non tax-deferred part (about half, $700k or so) of my portfolio in a short-term annuity that pays 4.5% to try to mitigate against losing too much more if there’s a recession, keeping the rest in 70% stocks or higher.

It'll be an unprecedented trend that no one really knows how it will play out exactly, but there are a few ideas: 

* First world countries will lean heavily on immigration to sustain the workforce (we're seeing this now), until the pipeline dries up

* Programs like Social Security and Medicare will cease to exist in their current forms since there will be more people drawing from it than paying in

* The housing market will flip upside down, there will be more houses than people so entire markets will crash and probably never recover, the hardest hit being the suburbs. Cities should still be okay.

* Global GDP will tank, so stock markets may start declining or going sideways due to smaller workforce/less innovation. Deflation is a definite possibility

* AI/Robotics will probably be a huge player in some form, maybe quantum computing finally?

I was recently released from prison after serving 6 years for distribution of cannabis. 

Before I went in I had a brokerage account with Wells Fargo. When I came home about a month ago I had a lot of notifications that my account needed to either be liquidated and closed or transferred to another institution immediately. 

I tried fidelity but they don’t accept felons. 
Another felon I know tried robinhood but they don’t accept felons. A friend recommended Chase because they have a policy where they hire people with adverse backgrounds, so I called Chase and spoke with two different advisors and they confirmed that, yes that is JP Morgan Chase’s policy and they confirmed that there would be no issue with me opening a brokerage account. 

So I opened an account and I even had a senior advisor in the escalations department make a three way phone call with me to the Wells Fargo advisor to confirm to Wells Fargo that the ACAT was legitimate and so Wells Fargo could lift the restrictions off my account to complete the transfer. After the phone call, it took about 2-3 days for the ACAT to go through and I had a fully functioning brokerage account. 

I began adding more legitimate funds through a bank transfer and bagan buying stocks and ETFs. I woke up this morning with an email that said I had an important account notification. I opened my account to check the notification and it said that “after further review” JP Morgan Chase has decided to discontinue services with me and have given me until May 12th to liquidate my account or transfer my positions to another institution. 

I believe that FINRA has rules about felons having brokerage accounts and it seems that every banking institution is associated with FINRA. Does anyone have ideas of what I can do? 

I considered opening a trust and making my sister the trustee and listing myself as the beneficiary. There has to be someway to be invested in the market. If not, I’ll be relegated to 2.5% CDs and my finances are screwed the rest of my life. Any advice helps, thanks!


EDIT: yes I do have a secondary money laundering charge as well for paying my home mortgage with suspected proceeds from my drug crime.

Second Edit: I guess I should have been more clear.

Trump is going to do damage. There's no way around it. I'm scared about what is going to happen, just like everyone. However, the damage most likely won't end the whole country.

Trump will damage things. He may even cause permanent harm. But there's a different between significant permanent harm and everything going to zero.

TRUMP CAN EASILY CHANGE COURSE

We're dealing with a mercurial narcissist. I can easily see Canada/Mexico/EU/etc giving him some tiny thing, something that costs them very little. Then Trump turns around and declares he has made the biggest, most beautiful deal in the history of the USA and ends the trade war ""victorious"".

Selling a portion of my current 500 fund holdings (taxes aside since these accounts are tax-advantaged) to purchase other funds/stocks doesn't seem to make sense since that would lock in losses, but at the same time, investing less proportionally with future contributions also doesn't seem to make sense since AFAIK the aim of DCA is to buy the same amount regularly during high periods and low periods to take advantage of pricing (lower quantity when the price is high, higher quantity when the price is low), and my understanding is if you reduce what you're contributing (proportionally) into a fund/stock during a downturn, you're not getting the advantage of buying more at a lower price.

**Is there a good way to approach a rebalance during a downturn, or is it just a choice between two not great options?** I'm also not in any rush (in my mid 20s), so **would it make more sense to stay the current course and approach a rebalance when pricing hopefully recovers / is on an upswing?**

Specifically, I'm concerned about the US government defaulting on bonds, about the USD inflating without interest rates being appropriately raised to match, and about the administration taking steps down the road to block capital flight out of the US.

I don't want to be stuck in a position where the US economy melts down and my nest egg is trapped here and gets wiped out, so I would like to move my money abroad to a less risky environment.

Right now, my money is mostly invested through Schwab, plus a bit in a Barclays HYSA denominated in dollars. I'm looking for a Europe-based brokerage through which I can invest as I'm used to with Schwab, right now probably mostly in European government bonds but, generally, in international stock ETFs as well.

I'm not even sure which platforms, exactly, would be out of reach of the US government. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1bevdl4/what_are_some_trustable_brokers_in_europe_should/) about European brokers recommends IBKR, but that's actually based in Connecticut, so I assume it's no safer than Schwab or whatever? Trading 212 seems a bit like a Robinhood-type app for Europe, but it uses IBKR on its backend. That is maybe still safer than using IBKR directly, since the assets it owns through IBKR are presumably not traceable to individual accounts? I'd still probably rather be in something completely Europe-based as possible, since I don't want to take a risk on US securities or bonds for the foreseeable future.

I don't know whether I'm even thinking through the risks here correctly. Anyone have any advice?

I'm a dual US-Ireland citizen, in case that affects my eligibility for certain brokerages. Or perhaps not - maybe they tend to actually have European residency requirements.

I opted for Traditional IRA and put in the max of $7,000 in December 2024.

Many stocks in the market are significantly overvalued—Tesla, Apple, Costco, Palantir, and much of the FMCG and pharmaceutical sectors, considering their sluggish growth. Even Nvidia could see its valuation tumble if China or AMD develop viable alternatives.

Market crashes don’t worry me; they’re necessary and often present great buying opportunities. What truly concerns me is the long-term effect of excess liquidity. Inflation is brewing beneath the surface, and we’ll see its full impact in the years ahead. Over time, the velocity of money has declined while the money supply has surged, artificially propping up asset prices. My real fear isn’t a crash—it’s that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.

Bonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn’t a market for investors—it’s a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.

If inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins. After years of zero interest rates and relentless quantitative easing, my biggest concern is that when the real downturn hits, the Fed will have little ammunition left to respond.",0,,2025-03-15,0.0,0.9081,0.0,-0.5559343099594116,0.75,0.25,0.227025,-0.1389835774898529,0.04402071125507355,52.201035562753674,neutral

We have a new world order coming and it's a scramble in the jockey for position. Chaos seems to be the norm. Trade wars, struggles for the economy both domestic and global. Long-term trends have evaporated. The prez seems addicted to chaos. It seems a transformation is in place.

However, for the first time in history, a U.S. president has bargaining power with energy. The USA is chockful of natural gas and LNG export capability creates leverage. Trump didn't create that, he inherited it out of sheer luck. It remains to be seen what he does with it.

Global tensions, the fight for natural resources and the risk of geopolitics are front and center. Many fear the prez and his handlers have an agenda guiding them that's been decades in the marking. Who knows! What matters to me is what to do with my small 7-figure nest egg. I'm 71 and that money was hard to come by. Now what.

Invest in indexes? Dividend stocks? Do you think one can get 7%? 6%? 5%? (And those are pre-tax numbers?) In light of the chaotic factors mentioned above, would you invest in the U.S. market, foreign markets or a balance? Any thoughts on what you would/will do?

I often remind myself of Buffet's quote, ""Don't lose."" That has guided me for a very long time in my business, which was based on investing in natural resources. And also in equities. I do take some risks, significant ones, yes, but I try my best to pick winners such that, at least, I do not lose! (Thankfully, I have been right most of the time.) I also take some big reward, risky shots now and then when I believe in something.

What is your take on what to do from this point forward? TIA!

P.S.  I have a nice income coming in that provides a good living. The nest egg growth is desired for legacy. Some family but mostly charity.

EDIT:  For those who say don't worry, it's the same old song, for decades people think the party's over. As for me, I \*do\* think that chaos and a new world order is in store. I \*do\* think that an energy crisis is shaping up. I \*do\* think that the planet is revolting, that we are exhausting its resources and that economies will/must suffer. I \*do\* think geopolitical risks are worst than ever. I \*do\* think that trump's rise and acceptance is indicative of a very sick nation. And that his handlers are going to cause a shakeup like this country (and world) have never seen. So, that's why I think investing as if everything stays the same is flawed. If someone disagrees, that's fine but that is my take. I can't believe the news cycle I witness every day. It is truly unbelievable.

investing,The Special Case for $RDDT,1jc0bhz,Sad_Chest1484,2025-03-15 13:28:47,0,0.42,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc0bhz/the_special_case_for_rddt/,"Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.

Let's start with the fundamentals:

1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.
2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.
3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.
4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% QoQ. This is great for any share holder.
5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.
6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.
7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.

\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.

8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.

Downside / Bear bases:

1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.
2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how ""clean"" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.
3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.
4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.

Having said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.

Any dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%. People are paying almost triple for Palantir and other software stocks out there.",0,,2025-03-15,0.4019,0.9972,0.0,0.9072980880737305,0.75,0.25,0.550725,0.22682452201843262,0.3887747610092163,69.43873805046081,positive

Morgan Asset Management, the ETF offers a distinctive approach to U.S. equity exposure by utilizing proprietary research and concentrating on well-established, large-cap U.S. companies.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) said on Friday that its asset management division has launched the JPMorgan U.S. Research Enhanced Large Cap ETF (JUSA) on the New York Stock Exchange.

According to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, JUSA offers a distinctive approach to U.S. equity exposure by utilizing proprietary research and concentrating on well-established, large-cap U.S. companies.

The company said the fund is managed by portfolio managers Ralph Zingone and Tim Snyder, who bring extensive expertise in managing research-enhanced strategies.

It explained that JUSA is designed with a slightly lower active risk budget and a more significant number of holdings, providing broader diversification. “This makes it an attractive option for investors looking for consistent returns in their U.S. equity exposure,” the firm said.

The company has been implementing the underlying strategy since 1988, it added.

On Thursday, Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on JPMorgan to $275 from $278 while keeping an ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the shares.

According to TheFly, Morgan Stanley said the robust capital markets rebound it expected in 2025 is not playing out as anticipated. The firm is lowering its estimates for investment banking revenues due to recent market conditions, as volatility likely pushes out deal launches.

However, the brokerage noted that large-cap bank and mid-cap advisor stocks ""appear oversold against our new base case.”

Earlier this week, Bank of America, too, lowered its price target on JPMorgan to $285 from $300 while keeping a ‘Buy’ rating on the shares.

* Completion of Fastlender installations and license sale (high margin Saas model) expected soon
* The continued increase in market share in Canada and the reduction of competitors will allow HITI to increase prices and therefore gross margins
* Increase in white label products / elite inventory
* Recovery in demand for CBD products starting in Q1/Q2
* More favorable regulatory conditions in Canada
* Increasing scale will allow you to exploit operational leverage and increase overall efficiency
* Purecan Gmbh acquisition will prove accretive to Hiti's gross margins

* Over 1 bln annual revenue (not include Germany, only canada and cbd)
* Gross margins 30/40%
* 100 mln in fcf+ on an annual basis at a conservative level
* over 20 million subscribers with 1 mln in Elite members ( 5% of total )
* Expansion into new markets and verticals complementary to current products
* Innovations and strategies underway that we don't know about

I have a pension with my current company, as well as some previous smaller ones which I plan to consolidate at some point.

But now I’m ready to open a Stocks and Shares ISA and save money on the side to grow. Currently I only have cash savings, but I can see how my pension has tripled the last 10 years, as my money is sitting in a “fund”.

Ive been researching hard the last 12 months, I never was taught financial literacy by my parents, so I’m really grateful for this sub! 

But I don’t know why, I still feel so nervous to open up a Stocks and Shares ISA on fidelity/vanguard.  I find it nerve wracking, but it just must be a financial literacy confidence thing.

Anyway, I’ve narrowed this down to 3 funds. And I just wanted to get advice on which you guys think, is the best to invest in.

I’m looking for a global fund, as I don’t just want to invest in S&P, as I don’t think Trump will be good for the American economy in the long term.  

All of these funds seemed to have tripled their performance over the last 3 years and did ok during covid.

But I just wasn’t sure which of the 3 to go for. Just wanted to get your thoughts.

I’m looking to slowly build up a nice pot of savings over the next 20-30 years.

1. Vanguard Total World Stock Index (VTWAX)
2. Fidelity Index World Fund (MSCI World Tracker)
3. HSBC FTSE All World Index

I tbh I I’m just confused which one to go for.

Thank you.

I am a long term investor and I am thinking about the next 2, 5 and 10 years. I have no problem with the volatility.

This is a question of valuation only.

I want to zoom out and focus on the realiy and not possible future scenarios because nobody can see into the future and nothing is 100% sure.

I made a lot of research to understand the stock company and all the potential, but there is one question which I couldn\*t answer myself even tough I did some research on it. This question doesn\*t seem to be discussed here at all.

The only discussion I saw was this one here, where everyone was against the OP and couldn\*t really dissolve his concerns other then ""The future is great because of ....."" (which we all already know and which the market knows) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time\_to\_shreddit\_or\_is\_there\_still\_a\_chance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time_to_shreddit_or_is_there_still_a_chance/)

In this post he describes it well that only because a product and company and the future are great doesn\*t always automaticly mean, that the stock has to go up. I always like to look at overall trends and history. And If I look at all these other social media companies which rely mostly on just ads and have seen high user growth in the past and had a hype are going now side ways. If you just did buy and hold you did make money but these haven\*t been stocks where it just goes up in a straigth line. (can be very volatile, but with constant trend that its a winner stock) They mostly go sideways and have been staying on the same level for years now.

What I mean with winner stock, for example IBKR. They have had a lot of volatility and a lot of downfalls. (If you look back and zoom out it just doesn\*t look like this stock has fallen a lot during some periods)

For me it makes sense to invest more into Reddit if it will become a winner stock like this for example which has huge falls but the sucess is in a long term uptrend.

And yea, I know Reddit is now also making 15% of its revenue with AI deals with Google and OpenAI. This is of course nice and great, but ads will still be the main revenue stream for the next 5 years. The Ai deals are overhyped. Most Ais just keep scraping it and there is almost nothing reddit can do to limit scraping. it will still be cheaper to just scrape it then to make a deal with Reddit unless you are a giant company like Google or ClosedAi chatgpt

And yea, Onlyfans and Patreon paywall content has huge potential and will be great, but most users are still used to not pay for anything on the internet and will also not do so in the next years. Just look at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)

By the way, the [r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/) sub has been growing massivly over the past few months. Just recently cracked the 2 Mio subscriber and now already at 2.1 Mio users.

Twitter (before Elon bought it)

Of course you could earn lots of money with Twitter, but only with good timing. For example if you would have bought in 2014 at 45 or even 50, you practicly wouldn\*t have made almost any money. It only went up in the last few years, because Elon bought it. Otherwise it would have stayed down there.

Everyone always says ""Oh, it gotta be at least as much worth as Twitter which was 40 billions"" - But this was only worth that much because of the buyout which many said was way way overpriced. As you can see on this chart Twitter was mostly not worth 40 billions. So this argument sounds good but is lacking.

Twitter has had comparable user amount to Reddit. (not exactly the same, but better then comparison with SNAP)

If I invest in something, then I don\*t want to rely on insanely good timing of buying into and when to take profits. Maybe you buy in cheap but you see the trend of the ricing prises and think ""yea, the future looks great, the product is getting better, more users ...), but you don\*t realize that the stock has become way too overvalued.

Basicly all these Social media stocks crashed after Corona was over.

SNAP

It\*s a bad comparison because there is a logical reason why they can\*t grow ad revenue as reddit can: The users mostly use it for chatting and you don\*t want to have ads in your chat, otherwise you will just switch to whatsapp or instagram or whatever kids use these days.

PINS is now worth $21.66 B. ([https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/))

RDDTs Marcet cap is now currently $23.19 B [https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/)

Now RDDT is attractive because it has way more users then PINS and in all the things which already have been discussed a lot way more potential then PINS. The valuation now seems attractive in a comparison. PINS is not in a hype at all, so it should be good for comparisons.

I am not Expert with PINS. I asked several Chatbots to compare these two and what exactly went wrong with Pinterest.

It seems that since 2022 the users growh has been slowing down of the monthly active users. Sounds similar. This has been happening to Reddit recently and will always be a huge danger for shert term price also in the future because of too high growth expectations and hype.

More competition with Tiktok and Instagram for PINS.

Reddit is not directly competing as much with these platforms, so this shouldn\*t be such a huge issue for RDDT. Reddit is more based on Text and like a Forum.

Pinterest is just pictures.

The new ad formats and ad tools which have been introduced by PINS hasn't found as much acceptance by the people who do ad campagnes.

The strategy of PINS now seems to be the integration with e commerce to directly buy the product. This already has been discussed in this sub here and will also be probably done by reddit in the future. (It\*s not a priority according to the recent calls) This e commerce integration seems to take more time then expected.

""**Monetization Challenges**: Despite a substantial user base, Pinterest has struggled to effectively monetize its platform. The company's heavy reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising spend, especially during economic downturns or shifts in marketing trends.""

""**Pinterest**: As of January 2025, Pinterest's global monthly active users (MAUs) reached 537 million, marking an 11% year-over-year increase."" - I have never know anyone who has ever used that platform, but okay.

The issue also seems to be that Pinterest hasn't been able to attract those big advertisers that constantly run ad campaigns. Reddit is starting to get more of those big names in and already has been sucessful in this (at least to my current knowledge).

Summary of PINS: Similar problem - growth can slow down - more users doesn\*t automaticly translate into more ad revenue per user - diffictulty to compete with big more advanced advertisers like META, Google, Tiktok, Insta.

If I would want to run an ad campaign I probably also would just go to google or Meta because these are know. I guess that most marketing people currently don\*t see Reddit at the same level as an option to run their ads there, because of lacking features out of the perspective of someone who is used to the great suites of Google and Meta. (I am not an expert in this) This is also a chance for Reddit to copy the same things those big guys are doing to make it easier for people to advertise. This must also work about branding.

If you look at companies or organisations, in the last year everyone and their mother has created a tiktok account and started advertising there, because of the hype. Tiktok became a name that became so important, that even as an old person you couldn\*t avoid it. Look at all these politicans posting weird tiktoks. Look at all these companies advertising there, because they hope to profit from the hype. Every institution or politican has a tiktok, insta, even X or nowadays bluesky account. Many even have Threads, but nobody has Reddit. Literally nobody. I know Reddit is a community and not a I follow this guy platform, but this is also a huge reason why not so many people advertise here compared to the big platforms.

\-Reddit has to also become a name you can\*t avoid as an advertiser. I don\*t know how we can get there. Maybe other platforms will get worse and thats why people start advertising more on Reddit for the community and the engagement, because it can be more specific.

So if we break it down to what can\*t happen for the stock to suceed long term:

\-user growth slowing down

\-expected Revenue can't be delivered because more users doesn\*t mean more revenue per user

\-competition with big ad brands (out of the perspective of an advertiser, not of the content platform itself for its users)

\-short term hypes (you buy in when its overvalued and it never ever goes back to this level again)

\-stock going sideways and staying on the same level as Pinterest

!! You had a lot of opportunity cost because you could have also invested in a stock which brings returns!!

Also, this is not investment advice, please be careful!

Rationale:

US stocks currently represent about 50% of global equity market capitalization. However, when you factor in corporate debt, the full picture changes significantly. A company’s enterprise value is calculated by adding its market capitalization to its debt. For example, a company with a $200 million market cap and $70 million in debt has an enterprise value of $270 million. This adjustment implies that American companies effectively account for roughly 70% of global equity value, leaving about 30% for the rest of the world.

Given the current economic climate in the United States, major indexes like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ may not offer sufficient diversification.

So I have a bit of an issue. My uncle has recently joined a life insurance MLM company (Global Financial Impact) and is trying to convince my grandmother to invest money into this for her grandchildren’s retirement (including me).

Quick summary for those not aware: FLCG was launched on July 30, 2024, and is benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Growth Index. As of February 28, 2025, it has $11.8 million in assets under management. The fund has had a -7.32% year-to-date performance as of March 12, 2025. It carries a 0.49% gross expense ratio and a 0.39% net expense ratio. The ETF is managed by MDT Advisers at Federated Hermes and follows a large-cap growth strategy, focusing on stocks expected to deliver above-average growth.

The fund is still relatively new, and while its strategy seems sound, its AUM is still low, which raises some concerns about liquidity and sustainability. Given its negative YTD performance, do you see this as just short-term volatility, or does it signal deeper concerns about the fund’s selection criteria and overall approach?

Also, with a 0.39% net expense ratio, how does this compare to other large-cap growth ETFs in terms of cost efficiency vs. performance? Would you favor FLCG over more established alternatives like VUG or QQQ?

investing,Why is it a bad idea to take your money out of the market if you are expecting a downturn?,1jb9ba5,ErroneousEncounter,2025-03-14 13:23:40,0,0.47,163,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jb9ba5/why_is_it_a_bad_idea_to_take_your_money_out_of/,"Basically as the title states…

Let’s say you were 100% invested in VOO/VTI and decided to sell all of your stocks when Trump started levying tariffs.

Say you sold a little below the S&P500’s all time high of 6147.

You could hold out and wait for a bit and re-buy in if the price hits ~5000 for example. If it eventually goes back up to 6147 you just made roughly 20% more than people who didn’t pull their money out.

And if you are wrong, you can just throw it all back in when it reaches ~6000 and you basically end up doing no worse than people who never sold. 

For tax-advantaged accounts (401k, Roth, etc.) the only negative I can see in this strategy is the loss of dividend payments… so keeping your money out too long is probably a bad idea. But keeping it out for a few months doesn’t seem like a bad move at all.

Can someone explain?

Some weren’t surprised by this revelation, including myself. As a Brazilian and former XP client, I’ve been watching reports of massive client losses for months. Several YouTubers have also shared their horror stories with $XP, such as this one titled ""[I OWE 100,000 REAIS to XP Investimentos](https://youtu.be/VwL2GW382uc?feature=shared)"".

Another interesting fact: any random person can become an XP ""investment advisor"", since it’s not an employment contract. You just need to bring in clients with money to invest in their products. Of course, these advisors get a nice commission, regardless of whether their clients lose everything.

To top it off, today $XP announced that they will sue Grizzly Research, triggering the infamous Streisand effect with lots of news  about it.

The funniest part? XP grew into Brazil’s most respected brokerage, practically exclusive to the wealthy, and was synonymous with quality—just like Madoff, haha.

Also, up until recently, XP was partly owned by Brazil’s largest bank, Itaú, which held a 50% stake. But over the past 1-2 years, Itaú completely liquidated its position. I found it odd at the time—why would they sell out of such a ""great business""? Now it’s crystal clear why.

Looking for some ideas/advice on what to do with my investments/pension.

What would you do in my situation?

55 year old male in the UK, looking/hoping to possibly early retire in the next3/4 years.

Kids have left home, we have zero debt, house is paid off and worth about £400k, we will hopefully downsize and release £100k from that.

Got a stocks and shares ISA with Vanguard with about £80k in it, this has lost about £6k in the space of a month, I have cashed in £50k from it (left it in the account to invest in the future) which was in the S&P 500 and a worldwide stocks ETF.

I have about £265k in a private pension with Royal London, which again has lost about £20k over the last month, would you be looking to move what is in here into safer things like bonds?

Ive been on the Royal London site and its not the easiest site to navigate, my pension seems to be in 4 funds - American tilt, far east ex Japan, sustainable leaders and European, so at first glance it seems pretty well diversified.......... but when retirement is on the horizon, things are getting worrying at the moment.

My concern is that due to supply chain complexity, tariffs won’t simply raise the price on imported goods, it will create gridlock for goods that have multiple components and/or multiple back-and-forth border crossings.

Think of it like a freeway with a lot of cars, but moving pretty smoothly at 60mph. Then suddenly 20% of the cars are going 45 mph. And 5% of the cars stop altogether. This doesn’t just slow everyone down a bit, it locks up the whole freeway. 

I think the supply chains for most goods are currently like this. Most or all imported goods will face tariffs - this will cause price increases, but some suppliers may back off of selling to the US altogether. This will cause manufacturers to pivot to other alternatives, many of which will get quickly overwhelmed and cannot supply the demand. Some foreign suppliers will simply refuse to do business with the US. 

Just a few of these “stopped cars” will gridlock the entire system of international manufacturing and transportation, and I don’t think this is something the administration or the market seems to be taking into full account.

Even though all of the above are good choices, they are fundamentally missing commodities. 

Now I’m not a major advocate for gold or silver, but many economists argue gold will catch up to the levels of DEBT that have been created, just like in 1971...by some estimation, this could be as high as $35,000 per ounce at the current debt levels. This doesn’t include the reverse repo market or shadow banks.

Even while underperforming equities, gold still nearly doubled in the past 10 years, only a taste of what’s possible to come. The gold market has not caught up to the amounts of toxic debt printing the entire equities market ran behind the scenes. 

No doubt VOO is a ""strong"" investment for now, but who knows until when? And when the game is over, anyone holding gold will not lose as big; if you hold only equities or bonds, you risk holding fiat currency in the end, when the debt crisis hits the fan. Hold gold or silver, you never need to worry.

If you look at the chart of gold vs the S&P 500, gold actually caught up to the S&P 500’s pace in the 2010-2011 time period. 

Since then, the S&P has out paced gold, but if you look at the historical ratios of outperformance, gold is set to “catch up” very soon - a reversion to the mean. 

Not promoting either side here, just pointing out that it might be time to diversify your portfolio a bit by looking at long term trends and consider other strategies of growing/protecting your wealth.

I had maxed this out a few years ago and accumulated quite a few shares that have since increased in value.  I paused using this program after the price increased a lot and my timing was certainly positive.  With the current market turmoil and uncertainty the price has dropped and I think it might continue to do so for a while.

One of the gotchas with this program is that you contribute via deductions from your paycheck and, at the end of a quarter, the stock is bought at market price -10%.  Obviously this is good if the market price at that time happens to be a dip, but it could be a peak.  Also, the stock goes into a taxable trading account and you are responsible for taxes on the discount.  There are no restrictions from me selling as soon as the shares settle for a 10% gain minus short term capital gain taxes.

I'm confident in my company's ability to perform over the long term and I don't plan on selling any shares for quite some time.  So, I'm ok with weathering any short term price decreases.

investing,"""Past performance doesn't indicate future results"" vs ""time in the market beats timing the market""",1ja9z5h,AnonymousTimewaster,2025-03-13 07:40:38,347,0.83,300,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ja9z5h/past_performance_doesnt_indicate_future_results/,"People love to parrot ""time in the market beats timing the market"" around a lot these days to deride people who are exiting. But doesn't that go against the other truism of ""Past performance doesn't indicate future results"" ?

Here's the core problem: ""time in the market"" depends on the assumption that the market – especially the US stock market – will keep marching upward over the long haul. People are basically leaning on the idea that past performance will guarantee future results. The underlying conclusion? The market will inflate endlessly, so you might as well park your money in US equities and call it a day.

But what if that's not true? Let's be real: the US has held a pretty unprecedented position in the global hierarchy for decades, particularly since WW2. Free trade, stable governance, and a massive consumer-driven economy have made it the de facto ""safe haven"" for the world's wealth. It's been an environment that heavily favours investors, fuelled by policies and norms that protect capital and encourage entrepreneurialism. Or at least that was the game plan until roughly two months ago.

Things are shifting now, fast. The global economic order that underpinned US dominance is under siege. We're watching protectionist measures surge, geopolitical tensions heat up, and the overall stability that investors used to take for granted is definitely not a sure thing anymore. Worst case, we might even be on the cusp of watching the US morph into one of those “faux democracies” (like Russia or Turkey), where they still do elections but only pretend to be free and fair. That’s hardly an environment where you can just assume indefinite growth and bulletproof rule of law.

And that’s the problem with the old “time in the market beats timing the market.” It depends on the belief that the past is always prologue – that America will maintain its position, its strong institutions, its global leadership. But being top dog in the global economy isn’t some birthright that can’t be forfeited. It’s earned…and it can be lost. Especially if the US lurches toward a system where power is concentrated, institutions are weakened, and allies (or entire supply chains) get burned in the process.

Japan looked unstoppable in the ’80s; then it stagnated for decades. The UK was the global financial centre for hundreds of years; now it’s not. Why should the US be immune, particularly with internal political chaos and external challenges are piling up? If trust in the rule of law collapses or there's a leader who openly sidesteps democratic checks, how confident can you be in American markets as the ultimate safe haven?

None of this means the global stock market won’t rise over time – but it does mean that where those gains happen could radically shift. Maybe emerging markets become the new kings. Maybe commodities surge amid world turmoil. Maybe some emerging tech or decentralised ecosystem ends up being the safe bet we haven’t even considered yet. You can’t just close your eyes and assume “staying in” is always the best move. That’s blind faith, and we’re past the point where faith alone can carry the day.

And to be clear, I’m not trying to doomsay or, god forbid, even encourage anyone to pull out their investments. I’m just pointing out that blindly assuming the market will always recover - just because it always *has* - is a fallacy and a risk in itself. And maybe, just maybe, the people who *have* pulled their money out for the time being aren’t clueless idiots, but just people who have actually looked at the storm clouds gathering on the horizon and decided to hedge their bets. Maybe, at the very least, people could be a little less condescending to them.

If the game itself is changing, then clinging to the old rules feels like a losing proposition. The market might still “go up” in some form, but there's no guarantee that US equities will remain the biggest engine of global growth indefinitely – especially if American political stability continues to unravel. Past performance is not a promise, and this could be the moment we all finally learn it.

For the record, I'm still adding my monthly pension contributions to VUSA, but my existing piles (about £10k worth as I'm young and poor) were taken out more or less at the peak when Trump announced his original tariffs and showed he was serious about compromising America's position in the world.

Last week I made a “market” trade for $170k in my RRSP account an hour before the markets opened. When the markets opened the price was higher, instead of reducing my buy quantity Questrade unknowingly to me leveraged my RRSP account in the amount of $8,000. So i was minus $8,000 cash in my account. I didn’t notice this and there was no email or notification letting me know they did this. 4 days after the trade I get an email saying I need to add $8,000 to my account to cover the money they gave me, or sell $8,000 in stock to cover it. 

I can’t add $8,000 to my account because my RRSP contribution is maxed. 

The only option they are giving me is to sell $8,000 of stock. That trade is down %12, if I sell I’m out roughly $1,200. I’m not an active trader, so either my account down right now I would simply be waiting this out until the market goes up. 

My understanding is that you are NOT aloud to leverage registered account. That’s a CSR rule, in my 10 plus years with TD, they would always reduce my RRSP trade QTY to an amount where they could fill the order. 

What options do I have here? Questrade gave me a “customer success” person who essentially said Questrade did nothing wrong here. But they need me to pay back this $8k “immediately”.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true.

Fight me if you disagree with the thesis below.

In a nutshell:

\-the **market cap ($80m) is currently largely below the net asset position value ($213m),** while the company is cash flow positive with more than **$400m+ of revenues**

\-a cost cutting plan is currently being implemented and there is a lot to cut: **the company spent $170m on R&D in 2024...**

\-the management has initiated a strategic review: ""*we are undertaking a strategic review process and exploring a range of alternatives to maximize shareholder value,* ***including being acquired, undertaking a go-private transaction***"" (this quote is from Q4 24).

\-Market cap is so low compared to the net asset value, the stock could easily do 2-3x when the outcome is announced; **Goldman Sachs has been hired**.

\-In addition, a lawsuit has been filed against Google who is previewing Chegg's content in AI-powered search (IP infringement): Chegg could get **up to c. $500m in compensatory damages** due to revenue loss caused by AI Overviews (estimated at c. $100-200m annual hit)

\-Yes, the topline is currently declining 20%: this is a similar growth profile to what is coming for Tesla... **except that we are on less than 2x P/E and less than 1x EBITDA**, while having a positive **net asset position at 3x the market cap!**

\-Finally, **the stock is highly shorted**

**This is not a financial advice, just my own analysis. I really like the stock.**

\*\*\*

**Few numbers below as of 31-Dec-24:**

\-Market cap of $80m (current market cap as of today)

\-Cash: $161m

\-Short-term investments (government bonds): $154m

\-Long-term investments (government bonds): $213m

**=> total cash + government bond position: $528m**

\-Liabilities: a convertible bond: $359 + $127 = $486m

**=> Net cash position = $42m**

\-Properties: $171m

**=> Net cash position + value of properties = $213m (2.7x the market cap!!)**",0,,2025-03-12,-0.25,0.9451,0.0,0.7427232265472412,0.75,0.25,0.04877500000000001,0.1856808066368103,0.11722790331840516,55.86139516592026,positive

I've asked them to close my account at least 100 times in the hopes that they would then send me my money and I could carry on without them.

I've filed complaints with SEC, FINRA, and BBB; where else can I seek help, what else can I do?

I talked with my bank, they DO Have an IRA option, but they do NOT initiate the transfer; they will provide a document that I would file with Robinhood, and then hope they comply.   
Apparently this is how all banks handle this.  
Also, in the process of researching this, I found out that if I were to find another broker and set up a transfer, they too only ASK Robinhood to allow the transfer, but cannot force them to.

I make $141K/yr, which is $2,711.54 per weekly paycheck - $460.96 deducted to 401K = $2250.58 taxable. Correct?

I had 9 paychecks before the announcement, which total my taxable income to $20,255.22.

Since the announcement, I'm putting the rest of my paychecks directly into 401K. Which is what I *should* be doing, correct?

Then I'm expecting \~$10,500 severance, which I don't think that I can contribute to 401K.

I also invested $7000 into Roth IRA this year. But that doesn't effect anything until *after* I pull out, right?

I've read that I won't be taxed in LTG this year, if I made less than $48,350 total. Correct?

So I *think* that it'll be able to pull out tax free, if my LTG is less than:

Hey everyone, I've been building a portfolio with a $500 daily investment strategy (except for SHOP at $1000 daily) and wanted to get some feedback on my thinking and potential blind spots.

My current investments:

**Semiconductor focus:**
- TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor)
- AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)

**Gold/Mining exposure:**
- GLD (SPDR Gold Shares ETF)
- RGLD (Royal Gold)
- NEM (Newmont Corporation)
- FNV (Franco Nevada)

**E-commerce:**
- SHOP (Shopify) - double investment at $1000 daily

**My reasoning:**

1. **Semiconductors (TSM, AMD)**: With AI development accelerating and computing demands increasing globally, semiconductor companies seem positioned for long-term growth. TSM provides manufacturing exposure as the world's largest foundry, while AMD gives me exposure to both CPU and GPU markets.

2. **Gold/Mining (GLD, RGLD, NEM, FNV)**: I'm allocating to gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation concerns. I've diversified within this sector with both direct gold exposure (GLD) and mining companies with different business models (traditional mining with NEM, royalty companies with RGLD and FNV).

3. **E-commerce (SHOP)**: I'm bullish on continued e-commerce growth, and Shopify seems to be winning the platform battle for small/medium businesses. I'm investing double here because I see strong growth potential.

What I'm considering:
- Is my portfolio too concentrated in semiconductors and gold?
- Should I add more geographic diversity?
- Am I missing any key sectors that would balance this approach?

Would appreciate any constructive feedback or thoughts on potential blind spots in my strategy. Thanks!",0,,2025-03-12,0.3818,0.9106,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.514,0.0,0.257,62.85000000000001,positive

I’ll say “well where do you put your money then?” And usually it’s, “I have an account over at x y z bank…” 

It seems like most people don’t worry about fluctuations in stocks because they don’t even bother with them.

The tangency portfolio is defined by risk and returns, whereas the market portfolio is based only on market caps. Current market caps contain NO INFORMATION about historical risk and returns. So how can they give the same result?

For example, consider an alternative universe where I replace certain stocks with versions having half their rate of return, but correspondingly longer history so that the market caps today are the same. I don't need a calculator to see that the efficient frontier will be different in this alternate universe. But the market portfolio will be the same.

We can cook up similar examples for modifying volatility. In any case, it appears that we can dramatically alter the risk and returns of our assets while maintaining current market caps.

What I do believe is the EMH, if tangency is optimal and all investors flock to this same portfolio, then the market will BECOME the tangency.

I’m down about £100.00 at the moment - no problem. 

I plan on buying in around 2-3 years so am I best off cutting my losses now and moving to a cash LISA or do I just keep at it? I’ve come into a bit of money and I planned on maxing out my allowance for this year but I’m slightly reluctant for obvious reasons as I’m not sure 2-3 years is long enough for things to recover if it continues on a downward trend.

I know the risks involved with investing, I’m not sat tearing my hair out or running scared at the current situation as I have other ISA’s for me and my kids where I’m still invested. These are all long-term for me and I will stick with my regular deposits here. 

The cash LISA is probably the safe bet and I know I’d be at risk of missing out on any market recovery but I don’t want to wait 5-10 years if it could potentially take that long. Just looking for some sensible advice on what others would do here.

So we've presumably all done those risk profiling questionnaires and are eventually mapped to something like conservative, adventurous, 4 out of 5... but how are those things mapped in the first place? Who's to say that adventurous corresponds to 100% equities other than convention?

I'm exploring a different approach and would love your comments on it, but basically I'm trying to use these extreme days to measure the limits.

Basically, on a big red day, did you come close to the following:

\-deviating from your financial plan?  
\-calling your financial advisor?  
\-consider selling your investments?  
\-lose sleep or feel anxiety and stress?

If so, I'd argue you were at your tolerance limit and form there we can backward out your tolerable allocation.

For example, if I lost $25,000 on a $1,000,000 portfolio in a day and considered liquidating my investments, then a 2.5% loss in a day is my tolerance limit. I didn't break it, but I was close.

I get that bad days happen, how often can I stay the course when days like these occur? Are they acceptable every 30 days? every 100 days? every year?

Let's say I can accept a day like that every 160 days, then I can figure out my sigma which is normsinv(1/160) = 2.5 stdevs.  
Let's convert my 2.5% loss to an annualized vol with 2.5% \* sqrt(252) = 39.69%

Based on our frequency we're saying that 39.69% is 2.5 stdevs, so 1 stdev should be **15.87%**

From this annualized target volatility, we can find portfolio allocations that match our tolerance. At 15.87%, I can still do 94% equities 6% bonds.

How do you guys feel about this approach? I think it's more actionable than being rated on a scale of 1-5, or ""adventurous""

\*What are the behaviors that you think mark that someone is at their risk tolerance limit?

I realize there was a wall of math text above so I made a quick app to illustrate the calculation method I was describing. [https://risk-tolerance.replit.app/](https://risk-tolerance.replit.app/)

Edit: Another thing to do could be to verify that daily limit across different time frames. For example, if $25,000 dropped in a day is a limit, how about $25,000 \* sqrt(21) = $115,000 in a month? $397,000 in a year? Just to check for consistency.

A personal example is March 2020. The first -3% day stung but I held. But after several red days of greater magnitude I buckled and definitely was beyond my risk tolerance. The time between unusually bad days was too small for me to tolerate.

Edit 2 on the daily time frame I didn't consider the expected return to simplify, but I guess that meaningfully affects the expected ""bad year"" drawdown.

I'm fortunate to have enough money in investments (stocks/ETFs) to cover the minimum downpayment and still have a decent chunk of investments left over. I also have a safety net savings account. I'm trying to decide whether I should fund the downpayment just by liquidating investments or whether it makes sense to tap into my safety net account so that I can liquidate less of my investments.

On the one hand, liquidating investments triggers capital gains, whereas withdrawing from my safety net account does not. So preferring to withdraw from my safety net would reduce my tax bill. My investments are also long-term investments and the market is in a bit of a dip right now, so it seems like a bad time to be selling investments.

But OTOH, if I deplete my safety net then I'll want to build it back up. That will take time, and during that time I'd have to cover any unexpected expenses by liquidating my investments--potentially at a time when the market could be even lower than it is now.

Anyway, here’s a simple sample strategy I came up with which I wanted to share and also get other investor’s opinions on.

-5%… reinvest 10%

-10%… reinvest 10%

-15%… reinvest 10%

-20%… reinvest 10%

-25%… reinvest 10%

-30%… reinvest 10%

-35%… reinvest 10%

-40%… reinvest 10%

-45%… reinvest 10%

-50%… reinvest 10%

investing,Why do emerging markets ETFs trail US Total Market when their GDPs are largely higher?,1j823mc,Shallan_Stormblessed,2025-03-10 12:03:44,11,0.71,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j823mc/why_do_emerging_markets_etfs_trail_us_total/,"So as a young person I have been investing about 80% in US equities and 20% in international/emerging markets, since I'm betting on global diversification and growth in those markets. I also look at GDP growth in places like China, India, etc, and see that they are largely outpacing the US. However, that is not translating to returns that outpace the US



For example looking at FSKAX (US Total Markets)

17.50% 1 year, 11.54% 3 year, 16.05% 5 year, 12.30% 10 year annualized returns

Then looking at FPADX (Emerging Equities - about 65% composed of China/India/Taiwan)

9.98% 1 year, 0.30% 3 year, 3.89% 5 year, 3.23% 10 year annualized return

  
What am I not understanding? I realize that these are just baskets of individual holdings, but I would expect to see these emerging markets doing better than they are. Is this a matter of more money being pumped into the US so prices are rising faster even if GDP is going slower? Is GDP just flat out a wrong proxy to be thinking out potential market growth?

That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

The result of any trade is hinged entirely on that number; whether you lose money or make money is just the difference between your entry and your exit so it is something very important to analyze. If you disagree with that please let me know why.

So the reason why I am asking this question is to get some insight into the world as I know how I enter and what tools I use but I am always open to learning how other people make decisions. My particular method begins with the end in mind; I know what I want to sell for and know what that return is so I build the price in reverse and thus set a limit order for that price; if that price never hits I am out nothing and just move on but if the price takes I then have a solid get what I am seeking to acquire. By no means do I use any complex mathematics but I do use some probability and light tree work to see when I should let a trade go. 

For people who DCA specifically do you have any specific times you choose to align to? For instance if you know that a company pays dividends in a period which lowers the price by the cost of the dividend\* do you use that information to buy at that point? Or are you time insensitive and instead DCA more often to remove volatility, such as weekly (or even daily) versus monthly or quarterly? I find it interesting but I don't actually practice DCA so I am curious how it has worked out.

So, I’m looking for some advice on at which levels, in a potential further dip, you would personally deploy if you were in my shoes.

I’m really looking for a strategy of sorts. Specifically, I’m considering investing the bulk of my funds in XEQT, which aligns with my long-term strategy. Even though I’m Canadian, I also have $22,000 USD sitting in a cash account, so I’m wondering the best way to deploy those funds as well.

For reference, I have some contribution room in tax-advantaged accounts:

* $87,000 in TFSA contribution room
* $8,000 in FHSA contribution room

With an investment timeline of 10-15 years, I’m in it for the long haul, but if I can deploy most of my capital during a dip, I feel like that’s the best route to go.

How would you approach this if you were in my position? When would you start deploying, and what would you do with the USD funds? Looking for advice on a strategy to make the most of this opportunity.

I'm looking at:

- [SGLP](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B579F325)
- [SGLN](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4ND3602)

They both have 0.12% TER, and their returns seem identical as they both track the spot price of gold (in USD). Both seem to be domiciled in Ireland. EDIT 1: one issued by Invesco and the other one iShares (originally wrote both are Invesco).

The question then is, what is their difference?

In the description of SGLP:

> The ETC replicates the performance of the underlying index with a collateralised debt obligation which is backed by physical holdings of the precious metal. 

And for SGLN:

> The iShares Physical Gold ETC is the largest ETC that tracks the Gold index. The ETC replicates the performance of the underlying index with a collateralised debt obligation which is backed by physical holdings of the precious metal. 

I am curious as to how I should interpret this. Both seem to use ""collateralised debt obligation"" which seems to suggest that they are not 100% physical gold backed, but rather structure their debt in some type of way. Is that significant?

In short:

1. How are they really different?
2. What could I read in the justETF page to spot the difference?

EDIT 2: I do not think justETF is enough to dive into the details here. I have now gone to their issuers (after noticing they are not both Invesco):

That day, I posted one of my first YT shorts saying this had parallels between what we saw in  the first carry trade shake-out in August 2024 (massive calls were bought in mid-July at relatively same order of magnitude). This call/these calls were effectively the top.

[115,000ish contracts bought at $0.75ish at the VIX C24.](https://preview.redd.it/8yhz6chmypne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761b624aac73af2cf364036c669eaf593c74226)

  
 It looks like that trader has taken *some* off the table (67% of the contracts, sold at a 180% profit). Cleared $8M in gains and still has 32% of their position running.

I argued that this was a trader betting on more pain ahead. The market tanked another 3% since.

[Today, these are marked at break-even\(ish\). But we did have a big Vix vacuum on Friday and before that these perceived lotto ticket\/hedges were up anywhere from 10-15&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/w6opo570zpne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=af19621a9c7e46bbb26625ff85562400c8db79ec)





Point being, though some counter-argued saying that these could be hedges against massive huge AUM, I am still of the opinion that someone out there knew that the market was going to be sell-off to a degree. Since then, all major indices have reverted back to the 200D MA. Puts have paid off.

 

[The market is at a critical juncture. Watch this closely as we may be at an inflection point.](https://preview.redd.it/542fsbb2zpne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b181675dfc8b7203e21c5b9c1e5d9cf5c617ae69)

 

 

 

What’s next? Hard to say. Buying puts at these levels at elevated volatility means you’re risking more to make less (insurance/puts are expensive), even if you’re directionally right. Personally, I think we’re at the beginning of a deflationary cycle as evidenced by things like $WMT, $COST earnings showing consumer weakness, Oil and $IWM has gotten bodied and job market is softening, to name a few. “The economy is fine”, says JPOW, well – it looks pretty fucking far from fine.

 $TLT calls and the index itself is now my main play. We saw some aggressive $TLT action last week, and IV is still relatively low. Trump may not be able to force the Fed’s hand, but his tariff flip-flopping and public sector job cuts could shake up markets. Yes, tariffs are inflationary, but the rapid policy shifts could create short-term deflationary pressure—leading investors to a *flight to quality* in Treasuries.

 

 

[Big money moving silent on the options chain in the TLT](https://preview.redd.it/w06y0kg3zpne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0458fc535ce06663211d6b962901685ff2725f56)



Also, if rates don’t go lower. We’re fucked.

Wild times.

 TL:DR –

* Trader who bet on volatility (Feb 19) effectively called the top (Feb 20). Market has been in shambles since, but betting on more downside is very expensive.
* The stock market is currently at a key technical level (200MA), and these are key levels to watch in the next week.
* The bond market is all over the place, but the economy is showing signs of weakness and I suspect rates should head lower.

26m, London, £30k annual salary (expected pay rise for the next tax year) with a stable accounting job. The salary is such as I only started about 18 months ago and doing exams to become qualified.

I have been fortunate enough to have maxed out my £20k Individual Savings Account (ISA - tax free investment/ savings wrapper) allowance for 2024/2025, with money is in the Vanguard FTSE All-World and S&P500. This has been made possible with the fortunate position of not paying rent at home and only financially contribute with some family shopping. I am pretty frugal in my spending in terms of the basics such as not eating/ drinking out and planning WFH days on when my dad drives into work (my workplace is enroute his journey and allows for good 1-2-1 bonding time). This does not stop me from socialising with friends, occasional trips abroad and even contributing towards a special bday trip for my parents to some states in USA earlier in the tax year.

There is about 2 weeks off from work this month, in which I have pondered about going on a last minute holiday to Brazil without dipping into my ISA. The initial plan was to put this money towards maxing out my LISA asap for the 2025/26 allowance and letting the money accrue in a HYSA for the time being, however I have stupidly put the money into an invest account with money in the the Vanguard FTSE All-World and S&P500. Since putting the money in, I have lost about £150. My concern now is taking the money out and humbly taking the loss of £150 and pay for the holiday within my budget or wait it out in the longterm.

If we treat stocks as a store of value, like Bitcoin, gold, or even Tesla, does that make traditional macroeconomic analysis less relevant?",1j6jbvv,ttforum,2025-03-08 10:19:56,0,0.38,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j6jbvv/are_stock_valuations_simply_a_product_of_investor/,"I have been thinking about how we value stocks and why traditional macroeconomic analysis still holds water in today’s markets. Typically, stocks are evaluated using earnings, growth rates, interest rates, and other economic indicators. Yet, oftentimes prices seem driven more by narrative and investor sentiment than by fundamentals.

Tesla offers an example. At times, its stock price has soared far beyond what traditional metrics might justify. Much of its valuation appears linked to the story of its potential to revolutionize energy and transportation. Many see Tesla not simply as an auto manufacturer but as an innovation pioneer. Its market value then reflects the belief that investing in Tesla secures a piece of a scarce, transformative opportunity.

Consider Bitcoin. Its appeal stems largely from its fixed supply. Investors treat it as digital gold, a scarce asset that preserves value even though it does not generate revenue. Similarly, gold is prized not for income but for its long history as a reliable store of value, especially in uncertain times.

This leads me to ask: if investors increasingly view stocks as stores of value like Bitcoin or gold, does that lessen the importance of macroeconomic fundamentals? 

Are we increasingly buying into a narrative based on scarcity rather than relying on hard economic data?

Do you guys think it is still worth it for someone my age to try and max out an IRA every year starting at 39 until I retire (I’m not sure what age that would be honestly)? 

Thanks all, and good luck out there in these times.

The consensus seems to be either to liquidate your holdings and sit on your cash or switch investments to European or other world funds.

I currently have everything in a Fidelity World Fund which seems to be massively weighted towards the big American tech companies. I’m wondering whether I need to consider switching or whether Fidelity would naturally change the portfolio depending on the performance of the American market. Isn’t that the point of having a managed world fund? I really hope so, as what’s happening in the States really worries me for the long term performance of my investments.

For the most part, because of sentiment mostly, I've not touched it at all, only selling off just enough shares to be able to make my yearly RMD, shoving any scraps of what was leftover from that RMT into FXAIX.  My father's passing is now long enough ago now that I've started thinking about what to actually do with this account.  I think my options are :

* Cash it all out now and close out the account, pay taxes on withdrawal, and use the money to pay off debt and/or open an investment account or HYSA.
* Sell all of the GOOG and reinvest in other things. (Taking out only RMD)
* Sell some of the GOOG and reinvest in other things. (Taking out only RMD)
* Leave it all alone. (Taking out only RMD)

Since it is an inherited IRA, I have to take the RMD yearly, or pay penalties. Are there any other options I am missing?  Which seems the wisest thing to do of those options?

I’m looking for feedback on a very aggressive 401(k) allocation I’m considering. I have a fairly long time horizon, want maximum growth, and don’t mind being hands-on with rebalancing. My idea is a 95% stock / 5% bond mix with the following funds:

* **U.S. Large Cap (40%)**: Schwab S&P 500 Index
* **U.S. Mid Cap (15%)**: Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Admiral (or Macquarie Mid Cap Growth)
* **U.S. Small Cap (15%)**: Fidelity Small Cap Index
* **International Developed (20%)**: DFA International Core Equity 2
* **Emerging Markets (5%)**: DFA Emerging Markets
* **Bonds (5%)**: Voya Intermediate Bond I (or Empower U.S. Govt Sec)

I know 95/5 is super aggressive. My thinking:

1. **Long time horizon** → Lean heavily on equities for higher returns.
2. **Small/Mid-Cap Tilts** → Aim for extra growth potential.
3. **International + Emerging** → Diversify globally, capture EM growth.
4. **5% Bonds** → Just a small stabilizer to rebalance during drawdowns.

I’m prepared for volatility (or at least I think I am!). I’d love to hear your opinions:

* Does this seem too aggressive?
* Any thoughts on these specific funds or alternatives?
* Should I bump bonds up to 10–20%?
* How do you handle rebalancing on such an aggressive allocation?

On one hand, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI and data center space, with demand for its next-gen Blackwell chips reaching unprecedented levels. Strategic partnerships with tech giants like AWS, Microsoft, and Google have solidified its position as the undisputed leader in the industry.

But here’s where things get complicated.

Recent stock sell-offs, partly triggered by Marvell's earnings report, have cast a shadow over the entire AI semiconductor sector, and Nvidia is no exception. To add fuel to the fire, fraud allegations surrounding Nvidia chips in Singapore have raised serious questions about the company’s supply chain, adding to investor concerns.

* FY2025 guidance is weaker due to new tariffs, which could impact supply chain costs and profit margins.
* Tariffs include a 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tax on Chinese imports, affecting 17% of BBWI’s supply chain.
* The report analyzes BBWI’s financial position, tariff impact, and mitigation strategies, highlighting the company’s strong fundamentals and investment potential.

Bath & Body Works (BBWI) delivered a strong financial performance in FY2024, particularly in Q4, despite challenges such as a shorter holiday season. The company successfully leveraged promotions and cost efficiencies to sustain revenue growth and expand operating margins, demonstrating its ability to navigate a competitive retail landscape. Wall Street expectations were exceeded, with EPS and revenue outperforming cautious forecasts.

However, BBWI faces new headwinds in FY2025, with weaker-than-expected guidance largely due to the impact of newly imposed tariffs. These tariffs include a 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tax on Chinese imports, directly affecting 17% of BBWI’s supply chain—10% from China and 7% from Canada and Mexico combined. The increased costs from these tariffs pose a potential risk to profit margins and overall earnings growth, causing investor concern. As a result, BBWI's stock has seen volatility, reflecting market apprehension about the company’s ability to offset rising costs.

The objective of this report is to assess BBWI’s financial performance, evaluate the impact of tariffs, and analyze the company’s strategies to manage these challenges. While the tariff-related cost pressures are a concern, BBWI remains fundamentally strong and undervalued. By examining FY2024 results, FY2025 projections, and broader market conditions, this report highlights BBWI’s ability to adapt to new challenges while maintaining profitability. The company’s proactive supply chain adjustments, pricing strategies, and brand strength position it to navigate current economic uncertainties effectively. As a result, despite near-term concerns, BBWI remains an attractive investment opportunity with significant growth potential.

investing,"Nvidia: Rising Competition, Valuation Concerns, and Shifting AI Investments",1j5tl9z,Goatofoptions,2025-03-07 12:01:54,0,0.44,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j5tl9z/nvidia_rising_competition_valuation_concerns_and/,"* Nvidia peaked in June 2024 and has been in a sideways correction.
* DeepSeek's AI model and high Nvidia valuation caused a sharp stock decline.
* Cloud companies' weak performance reduced AI chip investments.
* AMD and tech giants are developing cheaper AI chips, pressuring Nvidia.
* Nvidia remains dominant but faces increasing competition and valuation concerns.



In January 2025, Chinese AI company DeepSeek made a bold move by launching a new AI model at a fraction of the cost typically required. This raised concerns about Nvidia’s market monopoly, leading to a historic one-day market cap loss of nearly $600 billion. The stock had already been struggling after peaking in June 2024, showing signs of a broader correction phase. Weak cloud profits and reduced AI hardware investments from major cloud companies added to the downturn. Despite Nvidia consistently beating earnings estimates, its high valuation has investors questioning its long-term sustainability. The company’s $2.8 trillion valuation, trading at 12.5x forward revenue for FY 2027, has been flagged as a major risk.

Nvidia’s latest earnings exceeded analyst expectations, beating EPS estimates by $0.04 and revenue estimates by $1.19 billion. Annual EPS growth remains strong, but the stock failed to rally due to external market conditions. Major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft underperformed in cloud revenue, signaling a slowdown in AI chip investments. Investors are concerned about weakening demand as new competitors introduce cheaper AI models. Nvidia forecasts a 56% YoY revenue increase for FY 2026 and 21% for FY 2027, yet risks remain as the AI chip market becomes more competitive.

Amazon, Microsoft, and Google account for nearly half of Nvidia’s data center sales. Their investments in Nvidia’s AI chips have powered cloud AI workloads, but recent underperformance in cloud revenue is forcing them to reconsider expensive AI hardware spending. Companies are increasingly looking for alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, such as in-house chips and more affordable AI models. AI training, which once required millions of dollars in Nvidia GPUs, can now be done for as little as $50 using new techniques. Alibaba’s latest AI model has surpassed DeepSeek, challenging Nvidia’s dominance. With cloud growth slowing, hyperscalers are cutting back, further threatening Nvidia’s future revenue.

Competition in the AI hardware space is intensifying as more companies shift away from Nvidia’s expensive GPUs. DeepSeek’s R1 model is now available on AWS and Azure, gaining rapid adoption due to its low cost. Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max is reportedly more advanced, further pressuring Nvidia. Research from Stanford and the University of Washington has demonstrated that powerful AI models can be trained for just $50, proving that high-end GPUs are no longer necessary. Major tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are investing in custom AI chips, reducing reliance on Nvidia and reshaping the market.

AMD is rapidly expanding its AI chip business, positioning itself as a strong competitor. CEO Lisa Su expects tens of billions in AI chip revenue annually, and the company is accelerating the launch of its Instinct MI350 to compete with Nvidia’s flagship chips. Other companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Amazon, are developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. These alternatives are proving to be more efficient and cost-effective, which could threaten Nvidia’s ability to maintain its premium pricing and dominant market position.

Wall Street remains skeptical about Nvidia’s valuation. The stock is trading at 12.5x forward revenue for FY 2027, with a high forward P/E ratio of 25x FY 2026 EPS estimates. Comparatively, Alphabet trades at 18.5x forward P/E, making Nvidia look significantly more expensive. With Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seeing weaker cloud revenue growth, Wall Street is pushing them to cut capital expenditures. If hyperscalers reduce AI chip purchases, Nvidia’s revenue projections may be revised downward, increasing concerns about the sustainability of its high valuation.

The future of Nvidia’s stock price remains uncertain. A prolonged correction could continue as the AI market undergoes structural changes. The company faces mounting competition from AMD, DeepSeek, and custom AI chips, which could erode its market share. If hyperscalers continue to scale back on AI hardware spending, Nvidia’s revenue growth could take a hit. Stock valuation comparisons highlight potential downside risks, with Nvidia trading at 12.3x forward revenue for FY 2027. Forecasts for Nvidia’s revenue range from $179 billion to $334 billion, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the company’s growth potential. While Nvidia remains a dominant force, the increasing number of competitors and shifting industry trends suggest that its upside may be limited.

Financial data reinforces Nvidia’s strong market presence, with a 78% YoY revenue growth in Q4, reaching $39.3 billion, driven by a 93% increase in data center revenue. Analysts estimate Nvidia’s forward revenue between $179 billion and $334 billion, reflecting its market strength. However, Nvidia’s high forward P/E ratio of 40–50x, compared to Alphabet’s 20–25x, indicates stretched valuations that may not be sustainable. Despite its leadership in AI chips, the emergence of alternatives is forcing Nvidia to adapt or risk losing ground.

Broader industry trends indicate a shift in AI and semiconductor investments. Hyperscalers are prioritizing efficiency over Nvidia’s expensive GPUs, turning to cost-effective AI models from DeepSeek, Alibaba, and academic institutions. Geopolitical factors may also impact Nvidia’s supply chain and stock price. Market performance suggests a shift in investor sentiment, with Microsoft’s stock down 20% from its peak despite the S&P 500 rising 10%. The AI sector is evolving, and Nvidia’s dominance, built on CUDA, faces growing competition from rising alternatives.

**TL;DR:** Nvidia’s stock has struggled since peaking in June 2024 due to rising competition from DeepSeek and AMD, reduced cloud investments, and concerns over high valuation. Despite strong earnings, Wall Street remains skeptical about its long-term growth. AI hardware spending is shifting towards cost-effective solutions, putting pressure on Nvidia’s pricing power. While the company remains dominant, increasing competition and hyperscaler cutbacks could limit its upside potential.

I think one less talked about reason to hold at least some bond in your retirement portfolio is to be able to buy the dip in times like this when you *have a long time horizon of 15+ years*.

Yes there is uncertainly in the short term but chance is also high that market will recover in the next year. If it does not, well you will sell bond to buy stock as part of your annual/semi-annual rebalance anyway.

Is this market timing? Oh yes. But is also a bit of common sense to buy the dip. BTW I will not risk my emergency fund or play with it in taxable accounts.

What do you think?

* defense stocks have gone vertical
* Germany has effectively abandoned its spending limits
* European unity is at an all-time high
* a desire for European sovereignty is increasing

In the past I placed bets on the defense sector, and while those will likely continue to pay off I have been exploring other sectors where Europe has been reliant on the Americans. This includes:

* cloud computing platforms
* software services
* financial services
* medical technologies

FinTech jumps out not just for sovereignty reasons but also for the simple fact that all of this additional spending (trillions over the next decade) will need to be processed by someone, and that someone is preferably going to be European. For now I have made a small bet on the sector as a whole (ETF is [ESIF](https://www.ishares.com/de/privatanleger/de/produkte/315815/ishares-msci-europe-financials-sector-ucits-etf) in Europe, [EUFN](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239645/) in USA) and am starting to dig into both the individual components and emerging FinTech companies. A shocking number of the firms in the index have seen close to 100% gains over the last year, so the question to answer is how much more revenue they can realize with the shift in spending from the USA and the increase in domestic spending.

As a black swan event, it is not inconceivable that the European Commission could ban MasterCard and Visa, using a mix of anticompetitive practices and European sovereignty as a justification [[1]](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/ip_19_2311/IP_19_2311_EN.pdf).

[Some are even arguing](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-big-takeaway-from-trumps-speech-he-needs-a-weak-dollar-d424f291) that the current administration is making decisions with the intention to devalue the USD.

My question is as follows: is it smart to convert most of my savings to Euros now, with the expectation that the USD will continue to devalue? My worry is that the USD will devalue to the point that I can no longer afford to live in the EU.

I have a Roth IRA which I probably need to early access over the next year or two. At the same time, I will be moving to the UK soon and needing my wealth in GBP. 

I am seriously concerned about a major exchange rate slide, impacting the value I can take out of the account in the future. I’m considering liquidating it, eating the tax and penalty hit, and converting to GBP immediately, as a hedge for my future. This comes with obviously huge drawbacks. 

I realized perhaps I can instead move my Roth investments to a fund that somehow mirrors the USD/GBP rate, so that if the exchange does slide as I fear, my fund would gain USD value. I bank with Schwab and am not sure if I could just directly invest in GBP in a Roth there. I’m not clear what, if any, funds might offer the above performance. 

Anyone have any suggestions? This is money that my family anticipates needing to tap despite the early withdrawal issues. Taking the hit now is preferable to also taking a hit later but getting way less GBP for it.

“Trump said he will pause tariffs on Mexican goods that fall under the USMCA trade agreement until April 2.

“After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “This Agreement is until April 2nd.”

I am debating on how much to withdraw, between 0-5%. I want to know much I can withdraw to continue growth in the account while deploying the money elsewhere. 

Background: 28, married, first kid on the way (we want more), financially stable with no real financial stress. I have a good job that I don't mind, my wife and I already run a small business on the side, we have one rental home (our first primary residence) and live in a long-term (forever?) home. Our mortgage is 6.8%, no other debt. No interest in starting a business, but am considering grabbing another rental property. 

I am setting up a meeting with the portfolio manager of the trust later this month, and will discuss withdrawal rates with them. I want to keep the fund ""aggressively"" invested with them, which seems to roughly compare to the Bogleheads 3-fund portfolio. I am really torn on how much to withdraw each year. 

With this new inheritance I plan to shrink my current monthly savings to enjoy life a little more. More trips, more hobby spending, etc. 

If I withdraw 5% each year, I will have the new ability to max out my Roth IRA and HSA accounts each year, and possibly my 401k as well. I could also forego maxing out my 401k and make additional principal payments on my 6.8% mortgage. Or, I could simply take out, say 2% annually, and just focus on putting that into the Roth and HSA.

investing,TopBuild: Q4/Fiscal 2024 Results: Challenges Amidst Growth,1j4wcl3,Reasonable-Green-464,2025-03-06 09:13:36,3,0.71,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j4wcl3/topbuild_q4fiscal_2024_results_challenges_amidst/,"TopBuild is maintained with a HOLD rating, as we lower its price target amid macroeconomic challenges, particularly in the residential housing sector. Despite low growth expectations, the company continues aggressive acquisitions and capital allocation strategies. Its resilient business model and strong cash flow support potential long-term growth, though short-term sales declines are anticipated.

Investment Thesis:

In our first TopBuild report in December, we started our coverage with a HOLD rating. Our original price target was $401. After the conclusion of Q4 and fiscal 2024 results, we maintain our rating. Nonetheless, we have reduced our price target by 3.3% to $388 instead. After receiving updated management guidance, we believe the current macroeconomic environment continues to be a major headwind. There is much uncertainty about the residential housing market. Growth is expected at low single-digits or negative year-over-year. This is despite management maintaining a strong acquisition strategy.

# Key Drivers

* **Acquisition Strategy:** TopBuild has a strong history of acquiring smaller insulation and building material firms. In fiscal 2024 alone, they acquired a total of 8 companies between installation and specialty distribution. In total, the companies annual sales totaled $153.1 million in annual sales. Most recently, on February 3, 2025, TopBuild acquired Seal-Rite. Seal-Rite is a provider of fiberglass and spray foam insulation for residential and commercial markets in Omaha and Lincoln. With the acquisition set to close in Q2, Seal-Rite Insulation generated annual sales of $15 million.
* **Resilient Business Model & Pricing Power:** Despite an uncertain residential and construction environment, TopBuild has shown resilience. Unlike say bathroom renovations or flooring upgrades, insulation is a necessity for residential and commercial projects. Additionally, serving both the residential and commercial markets helps to mitigate risks linked to slowdowns in any one segment. If new home construction declines or worsens, 35% of 2024 sales were still in commercial/industrial construction. The insulation industry as a whole remains highly fragmented with many local and regional players competing at smaller scales. TopBuild has capitalized on its scale to unify growing market share via strategic acquisitions. TopBuild is unique because it has a vertically integrated business model. It combines installation services (TruTeam) and distribution (Service Partners) under one corporate umbrella.
* **Cash Flow Generation:** A major aspect of TopBuild's investment appeal is due to their effective capital allocation. The company has demonstrated a willingness to use strong cash flow generation to fund their M&A service offering. Aside from acquisitions, TopBuild is known to repurchase their outstanding stock. In their Q4 and year-end results, management announced a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion worth of shares. This new authorization is adds to the $188.1 million remaining from the prior announcement as of December 31, 2024. While free cash flow did decline by 10%, the company still reported strong results with total generation of $706.7 million.

*Conclusion*

TopBuild's near-term growth is in a peculiar environment as costs stay elevated and labor shortages continue. The 2025 outlook provided by management indicated sales between $5.05 billion and $5.35 billion. The most-likely scenario is that sales will decline year-over-year. This would be the first time since becoming a public company a decade ago in 2015. M&A continue to be a priority moving ahead with one already planned to be completed in Q2. Acquisitions have proven to be a strategic growth aim with 8 taking place in 2024 contributing $153.1 in annual sales. With their strong free cash flow generation, TopBuild continues to repurchase a significant amount of shares with their newly announced $1 billion program.

Despite short-term concerns, TopBuild is well-positioned for long-term growth due to structural housing supply constraints. There is a strong reliance on an uncertain residential housing market. Still, management expects low-single digit growth in commercial/industrial sales. These sales account for a growing $1.88 billion in sales (43.9% total).

# Risk Factors:

* **Residential Construction Sensitivity:** With 61.7% of sales coming from the residential market, a downturn can significantly reduce insulation demand. Management already expects a mid-single digit decline in fiscal 2025 which is set to hinder overall sales growth. Although TopBuild has diversified into commercial/industrial insulation, the residential market is heavily relied upon to continue growing. One of the primary drivers of housing market cyclicality is the cost of borrowing. Mortgage rates stay elevated with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage hovering around 6.7%. While rates have fluctuated, the high cost of financing a home persists. This has led to lower housing demand. As a result, existing home sales have declined.
* **Raw Material & Supply Chain Risks:** There is significant dependence on raw material availability. Cost fluctuations in insulation materials, particularly fiberglass and spray foam, pose concerns. If raw material costs increase and TopBuild can't pass them on to customers, profit margins will be squeezed. In recent years, logistics bottlenecks and material shortages have affected the insulation industry leading to higher costs and delayed projects. Both of which hurt overall sales.

Right now, the S&P 500 P/E ratio is around 22–24, while the long-term average is 16–17. If earnings grow at 6–8% per year (which is historically normal), it would take 5–7 years for the P/E ratio to fall back to historical levels—assuming stock prices don’t move.

Basically, if we’re in a sideways market but earnings keep climbing, valuations will gradually normalize by the end of the decade. So even if prices don’t rise, long-term investors still “benefit” from earnings growth bringing fundamentals back in line.

This is easily concluded by looking at the current PE ratio and comparing that to historical averages.

Let's briefly look at what this means from a return on your invested capital.

* P/E at 28.95 translates to a TTM yield of \~3.5%
* Next you need to account for earnings growth in the future. Let's assume earnings grow in line with GDP growth
* Average annual real GDP growth has been 2.5% on top of healthy inflation of 2%
* Thus, your expected annual return will be \~8% (2.5+2+3.5). This assumes that the long term GDP growth and inflation are in line with historical averages.
* Now the historical annual return of the S&P 500 is \~10%. Based on current valuations, in order to achieve the historical average annual return over a long period of time, nominal GDP (real growth or inflation) would need to increase 2% greater than historical averages. 
* Alternatively, valuations would need to continue increasing consistently and sustainably which is highly unlikely, OR long term future annual returns of the S&P 500 will be less than historical returns

None of these things has ever happened sustainably over a long period of time, even through technology and industrial revolutions, which is why an overvalued market has real consequences in terms of expected returns, and why imo folks like Buffet are hoarding cash.",0,,2025-03-06,0.0,0.9779,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.244475,0.0,0.1222375,56.111875,positive

What seems certain right now however is a need for increasing national self-reliance in areas that are critical to defence, commerce and manufacturing. With that in mind I have decided to make a notable investment.

When considering where to invest, in my opinion the United States is a far less appealing place to invest now than only one month ago for various reasons. Not only is there considerable political volatility and a worrying descent seemingly towards a divided, bellicose autocratic nation, apparently aligning with formerly hostile states such as Russia at the expense of long standing allies, but there is also a growing backlash to the conduct being witnessed, from within and without the United States.

This backlash includes, boycotting American companies, particularly those whose leaders have ‘kissed the ring’ and may now be supplicants, at the whim of the new administration. I expect the early impact of this boycott to be visible in the next reporting season which is only about two months away. With 41%¹ of revenues generated outside of the United States for companies within the S&P500, according to Citi Global Wealth Investments, I expect the boycott may cause various companies to miss expectations, perhaps notably.

With that in mind I have looked closer to home for my next Double Bubbler investment and in an area central to defence, commerce and manufacturing. One industry that underpins these areas, and may gain from an international shift away from American manufacturers and suppliers, is that of satellite communications. So much of our modern society from trade to warfare relies on this essential technology and I expect the European Union and Britain to support their own regional champions.

Companies such as [SES A.S](http://ses.com/). who provide a range of satellite communication services around the world, with a particularly strong presence in Europe, including being the lead partner for a consortium who will be designing, delivering and operating the next generation IRIS2² MEO-LEO network part funded by the European Union. In short this will be a secure network for European governments, where SES retains the opportunity to commercialise ‘over 90% of the MEO capacity and part of the LEO capacity’.

In time I will write an article on why I bought 100,000 shares in SES this morning, however in brief it is their expertise, current global communications service offering as well as the potential of significant future business, a large proportion of which is already under contract. What I also particularly like about SES is that it is currently paying approximately 10% in dividends and is intent on increasing the dividend further ‘once SES meets its net leverage target of below 3x within 12-18 months’³.

While the future is uncertain, the dividend and apparent prospects for SES, give me confidence this may be a good place to weather the storm and even prosper perhaps. Hopefully with potential share price growth together with compounding dividend reinvestments I will double my money before too long!

Tariffs are inflationary—they raise the cost of goods and services and can prevent potential Fed rate cuts.

However, increased costs of goods and services can reduce demand, leading to economic contraction, which is deflationary.

Corporate tax cuts are inflationary, while reduced government spending is deflationary.

It’s been a while since I studied macroeconomics.

Whether it's NVDIA because you think there's an AI bust coming. Or you don't want to own TSLA because of Musk - there are ways to remove exposure of a component in an index. 

First - the easiest way to do that is to not hold that fund and find a different fund that fits your criteria.

But if you want to hold certain types of indices such as large cap indices but you want to exclude a large cap component - it is a bit more difficult.  

These are the different ways from most complicated to simplest.

1. Roll synthetic short futures with equivalent negative delta. 
2. Write equivalent negative delta using deep otm call credit spreads or naked calls.
3. Short the equivalent dollar amount of shares
4. Roll long short puts or put debit spreads.
5. Use a model-based replication service (usually only avail through an SMA/UMA program) which supports trade restrictions. 
6. If an inverse ETP exists, buy the dollar equivalent of the inverse ETP. 
7. Use a direct index solution which supports rebalancing.

My wife and I are looking for some advice, so thank you in advance for any assistance.

We live in a HCOL area. We make decent money, me $130k, her $160k, and are both 35. We have $90k combined in our 401k, another $50k between a ROTH and a T-IRA. We will max out both our 401ks this year. We also have about $225k in a HYSA.

Neither one of us wants to have a long commute, as we have a 4 month old daughter (We have started and are funding a 529 for her), and this means that we really can't afford a home or even condo in our area, we would have a mortgage of at least $7k a month after putting down the full $200k. Really to save money on housing we would have a 1 hr commute each way. Our current rent is $3,500 + about $350 a month in utilities. Our daughter just started daycare at $2,500 a month. 

I know we are in a better position then the average American but am just unsure how to move forward right now. We have talked with grandma about retiring and watching our daughter full time to save on daycare but it seems like a lot for her (She really wants to do it), and our daughter has taken to daycare well and is pretty social. 

  
I guess our question is, what would you do with the money in the HYSA? The S&P seems terrifying right now, the interest rate in the account has dropped from a high of 5.5% down to 3.5%. Would you invest in another markets real estate, put in an index fund, start a small business? How can we take this money and use it for something if it cannot help us purchase a home.

I will add, both of our jobs are a bit up in the air, and we are near the top of what we make in our industry currently. We could be a bit house poor and get a place, but it scares us both knowing finding similar jobs could take a lot of time.

My yearly rate of return it says is  9.29% for last year and 9% previous year.  Is this good? Should I leave it or should I really buckle down and choose my own stoc/bonds, index funds etc. I don't no much at all and have got lucky a couple times buying and selling on the regular market.

Originally, I started with 4-5k. About a 1.5 years ago, I started working my first real job and wanted to start investing in my future. To date, I have 2 investment accounts totaling about 22k. One of them, about 14k is based on the Dogs of Dow strategy. The other account, is through Robinhood and has the other 8. For the most part, the Robinhood account does not had a strict strategy to it.  My general thought process was that getting in the market and waiting was probably the strategy that would empower me to build a portfolio with the the time I could. Over the past 8ish months, I have been placing recurring investments in stocks and etfs (a lot of tech) to take advantage of the DCA. I know a strategy that essentially boils down to ""just buy stocks"" isn't much but it has worked pretty well for me thus far. It would probably be fair to say that I am ""long"" I think. 

  
My fears about an upcoming recession and instability in the global market have me questioning this strategy. Even if my portfolio is long and my timeframe lasts a few decades, do I need to change my approach? Should I just keep chugging and count on a upward correction in the long term (like years to decades)? Does it make sense to keep buying (like with recurring investments) if I anticipate the stock price of something is going to drop.

Listen, equities in particular are going to be volatile when there's an increase in uncertainty. Welcome to investing. The market is incorporating the effect of tariffs, counter-tariffs, deregulation, etc. on a number of different variables. Of course there will be debate, and that debate shows itself in the form of price volatility.

But guess what? Equities have always seen corrections, bubbles, bear markets, recessions, etc. Do you know what the ultimate, underlying lesson is for those?

1. You are not some special magic super genius that can time market tops and market bottoms.
2. As a result, the most plausible best case scenario for most people is buying and holding throughout the volatility.

Welcome to a normal market: there will be times when things are good, times when things are bad, and times where we're not sure where it's going to go. But unless you can point to a specific mechanism, with a specific catalyst, on how the stock market is going to explode, you're letting fear get the better of you.

TL;DR: Calm down, stop with the doom-posting, you're an investor for a reason, and hopefully that reason included a LONG TERM view with the acknowledgement that things will necessarily change and be difficult to determine. All the ""omg i sold out asap"" bullshit is either people complaining about the election results, or giving into fear to such an extent that they've hurt themselves.

The No. 1 evil in a socialist world. Also the entire idea of wealth building kind of rests on the idea of capitalism itself and trying to get ahead of others and creating more inequality.

So that means the rest is done between large institutions correct?  Stocks only go up and down if someone is buying/selling. Theoretically the price of stocks would stay the same if no one bought or sold for a day?

So correct me if I'm wrong, the constant movement of the stock market is pretty much institutions speculating between on another about how they feel the price of a stock is at any given moment and trying to get micro gains throughout the day by buying and selling between one another?  And the stocks they do this with mostly comes from 401ks and rich peoples money?

For example today after the Tariff announcements, stocks went down because a number of institutions felt is was to their advantage to liquidate and move their money elsewhere.... and another buyer/institution felt is was worth the risk to buy these at a lower price, with neither of them knowing what the best play was, but both taking a gamble on their feelings/guesses/data?  And as a result the market went down overall, even though another institution bought the stocks because they felt it was a good play to still make money eventually buy buying them at a lower price.

If you've made it this far, how is this not adult Trading Cards?  These stocks hold no actual value except what the next institution, rich person, retail investor is willing to pay for them.  Most don't offer a reasonable return by holding them.  And the companys stock you bought don't get any money directly from you buying them \*yes I understand they kinda do in indirect way\*, and yes if you have the majority of stocks you can dictate what the company does in a lot of ways, but that would probably turn into a disaster since almost no here on reddit knows how to run a company.....

And yea you can make money on trading cards and fades, but what happen when a fad runs out and the rich don't want to play the stock market game with their money, if no one wants your cards any more what value or return do you have?  These stocks don't give you money because a company is doing good, its the willingness for another buyer to buy your stock/card that gives them value.....

Here is the honest truth- if you have near term plans and need the money soon (next 12-24 months)- sell right now but only sell what you need to cover that expense. This will be different for everybody. If you're looking for your sign, this maybe it.  
  
We are in a vastly inflated market, and it may not recover for a few years. Prices have not reflected true value for some time now. There is reason to be concerned if you need to make a purchase and that money is pivotal to the purchase- now is a good time to reduce some of your assets- as the assets are mostly imaginary value.

If you can handle a 3-7 year financial storm, then don't sell. Hold everything you can.   
  
Whatever you decide, Cheers good luck folks. I made my moves in November before this storm started. :)

That went about as well as you would expect. He had $200k cash and its all gone. He is now $30k in consumer debt and developing signs of either Alzheimers or dementia, we don’t have diagnosis yet. 

He was living in NC and we are now moving him across the country to live near us so we can keep an eye on him. The plan for now is to have him live with us so we can assess his ability to function independently. 

He does have a fully paid house. Realtor is saying it will probably go for $300-$350k. He gets $2500/ month in social security. 

We will probably just keep the funds in a HYSA until we have a strategy. 

We could

1. Have him live with us until he requires round the clock care. Use the house funds as savings for him. 

2. If he is able to function independently for a while, he could buy a house here and live on social security. Or we could move in with him once he needs more help, then potentially sell the house when he needs more intensive care. 

3. Maybe something in between where he puts down a down payment on a house, we pay the mortgage, we all live together, and he has a savings left over. Again, could sell if he needed to recover his down payment. 

3. Something else Im unaware of. Maybe some different investment vehicle for the house funds. 

Oh and obviously the consumer debt would get paid through the sell of the house. 

Just feels weird to have that much cash sitting around. But maybe thats normal at this age.

I hope the market does crash, then it’s on discount. 

I can’t stress this enough. Just buy buy buy and cost average in over the long term. This is the nature of the investing game.

The data is right there. 

The past is very likely indicative of the future given how much probabilistic weight is behind the S&P’s data. 

Yes, anything can happen but the market has ALWAYS recovered. If it doesn’t, well then everyone now has far bigger problems. 

Be that person that buys right at the top *and* buy at the bottom. Investing is a game of cost averaging in over the long term.

*Especially* buy when the market crashes. Just buy as much S&P ETF whenever you can as much as you viable can over many years. 

What’s high now you’ll look back in the distant future and see that it was damn cheap, relatively.

Buy, cost average in, hold over many years, ignore your emotions, that’s it. That’s all you need to do.

It really doesn’t matter whether the stock market goes up or down. Outcome is positive either way from this perspective.

This was a huge mental shift for me. If it goes up you’re gaining. If it goes down you get to buy more for cheaper for it to eventually go up - so you’re eventually gaining by cost averaging in anyway.

This is the strategy and it’s a win-win strategy. 

Buy at the top and buy at the bottom it doesn’t matter. Keep banging money in to the S&P engine and let compounding do its thing. 

This is the long term investing game. Ignore all the noise and just buy and hold the S&P or an All World fund and you’ll very likely be just fine in many years to come.

This ChatGPT4.5 moment marks the end of the era of AI scaling purely from pre-training compute and therefore cast doubt on the entire projected trajectory of AI making massive leaps in increasing intelligence and there for real meaningful applications with AI, which Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also mentioned which was that AI currently has no real meaningful applications.

Both indicators suggest that consumption is down at the time being and inflation could see moderate declines. While I'm not an expert on the domestic and international demand of the dollar bond in the future, which seems to face some challenges, I do believe the inflation/growth expectation is the huge factor for 20-year treasury pricing at least for the short term. And with such a significant decrease of the GDP growth from the previous number, I'm not sure even a unchanged 3% CPI print could undermine TLT/ZROZ a lot.

I'm not sure the sentiment about long-term treasury is in this sub but I've been itching to make a move since the end of last year, when the yields are going over the roof to above 5%. I think the pricing back then was compounded with a lot of uncertainty brought by administration changes. I didn't buy long-term and watched the yield to go from 5% all the way to \~4.5% in the span of just 1 quarter. A lot of the intial fear of the uncertainties have been subdued. For now, the tariffs' impact is still not showing and I got this feeling that it will be a slowburn which could not change the course of the inflation. It will take us nowhere near the 2022 post-covid turnmoils.

For now, most of my portfolio is sitting in SGOV, with monthly coupons compouding to roughly 4+%. This is getting lower than last year. TLT's coupons are accumulating to a similar yearly gain. I usually have a habit of investing a several thousands into SPY/QQQ/SCHD per month but now I'll stop those payments and consider redirecting them to 20y treausry ETF. I'm deliberating on several options (1) put $30000 (roughly 30% of my total asset) in TLT to catch the potential gain in the upcoming CPI/FOMC announcement. (2) put $15000 in now and decide whether to increase the stake after the FOMC week. (3) just stop investing in SPY/QQQ/SCHD and stick with SGOV. Under the scenario where I decide to buy TLT, I'll probably dump it once the forecasts are back up or I reach a certain stop gain/loss point.

On a side but important note I was badly injured last year and have a traumatic brain injury  but this is not directly about that. 

Twice now basically the same freakiest has happened.   Some girl I don't know comes out of nowhere and starts talking to me online. Nothing weird or sexual.   One started on Facebook and was friends with a legit person I used to know. Both girls moved the convo to WhatsApp.   They talk for awhile about whatever.   It's actually a little annoying but I have time so I'm like whatever.   They both don't live near me at all.  

Here's the thing.  Both times they start talking about investing in crypto.   I have investments and am not bad there but nothing stellar just to set the record straight.   Then they want to teach me how to trade in crypto.  The first one pointed me to a free web based tool where you can play with fake money.  I now forget how that one ended but I stopped it somehow.   This last one wanted me to use a downloaded app.  I refused.   She then kind of threw a rod.  I definitely backed out.  She threw a bigger rod.  I blocked and reported her.

Is this a thing?  What the heck kind of game or scam was that?  The first one said bigger money to get in was needed - to get good rewards.  The second said i could start small but to start.

6 weeks to swing from 2.9% growth to 2.8% contraction.  That's a crazy level of slow down in the economy under this Administration in such little time.

It's such a bad economic forecast that the Commerce Department is wanting to hide the number by changing the way GDP is calculated. That's like North Korea or Russia just making up economic numbers. What in the world is happening here??

I kept thinking about this and was wondering, shouldn’t this strategy generate the most wealth over time?

Assume one bought VT and BNDW with a 50/50 weight and keeps adding to them every month. Whenever VT increases, you sell and add to BNDW, increasing your cash wealth. Conversely, you sell BNDW and buy VT when VT goes down, using your cash wealth to take a position in equities. Basically, you’re buying low and selling high. Over time, shouldn’t this automatic rebalance add up to significant sum compared to let’s say just having a 100% VT portfolio? Assume you only sell VT long term tax lots to avoid short term capital gains taxes.

Am I missing something? Why would a 100% VT portfolio outperform a 50/50 VT/BNDW portfolio over the long term. With the latter approach, you’re taking profits and building wealth so that you can buy equities when they’re undervalued.

I would like to rebalnacne to bring VTI and VXUS back to 70% and 30%, and looking to actually bring VXUS closer to 35% like the Vamguard target date funds. However, even if I DCA only into VXUS it will take over a year to reach this target while buying thousands of dollars worth per month.

And I’ve been keeping an eye on PayPal for quite sometime. I used to have a decent position in it before but decided to cut ties. This has been a couple years now. 

But now I’m checking it out again and it seems pretty damn solid for where it’s currently at. Am I missing something? Nearly all metrics seem very strong fundamentally. But I’m curious as to what the bear case is? What’s hindering the company so much? 

Because as I look at the company, it’s roughly 70B in overall valuation. Revenue continues to keep going up each year. (About 12% average over the last 3 years. Which is respectable.) They’re planning to buy an awful lot of shares back. (Based on what I’ve read $15-$20B worth over the coming years.) about $5B (give or take 1B or so.) back last year alone. The company is generating good cash flows of about $4-6B a year. If you throw the buy backs on top that’s some serious value back. 

To me, looking at the cash flow and revenue trend, the balance sheet, cash on hand, the massive buybacks, and everything else in between else just seems like a screaming buy. I don’t see many companies out there with this kind of presumptive value discrepancy. What are your thoughts? I’m personally seriously considering opening a position again for the long term.

MSFT - 1991 @ $1.08
INTEL - 1992 @ $1.64
CISCO - 1996 @ $4.21
QUALCOMM - 1999 @ $4.20
ORACLE - 1999 @ $7.85
APPLE - 2007 @ $3.05
NVIDIA - 2020 @ $6.11
BROADCOM - 2021 @ $44.56

The results are roughly 4350% Since 1990 to 2025. 

On average that is a return of 120% (ish) per year. 

You put $1,000 in each one, only once in the January of that year, that's around $350,000 return.

For example in the Dot com bubble in addition to tech stocks you had the collapse of Enron and MCI Worldcom. 

In 2008 in addition to bank stocks you had insurance such as AIG, big three automakers, General Electric etc.

2020 you had a lot of retailers that had been struggling for years file for bankruptcy.

Here are my predictions of who/what will be impacted:

*  Crypto - Too many meme coins and speculation. There will be a massive correction due soon not sure if as severe as 2022 but its coming
* Office Space REITS- some of these have recovered but I don't see their finances improving anytime soon as return to office has been very gradual. Also recent federal cuts will hurt demand especially in suburban office space markets.
* Meme Stocks in particular Tesla and Game stop. Telsa's PE ratio is way too high and Musk's recent antics have hurt future sales prospects. Gamestop also has way too high of a PE ratio. In a downturn people will turn away and its price will collapse
* Broadcast /Cable companies - These companies are struggling with cord cutting. In a downturn this will be first thing many consumers cut. Comcast is very vulnerable. Also any regional sports stocks such as MSGE will get hit. 
* Almost every remaining regional retailer that is publicly traded. I'm not sure how many of these are honestly left but any non national retailer that does not have a decent web presence will have a decent chance of not surviving next downturn. 
* AI related stocks. Companies have been spending hundreds of billions for their AI buildout. There will be cuts to AI budgets that not only impact NVDA and AI oriented stocks, but any REITs that own data centers, power companies doing build outs 
* Oil and Gas companies. US production has increase significantly even after blip during pandemic. Due to higher drilling costs in the US expect any dip in oil price to wipe out a lot of producers especially if they are too leveraged in debt.

I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm asking this question largely in the spirit of understanding the forces involved in the gold markets, and deepening my understanding of precious metals as an asset class beyond ""an insurance policy against volitility.""

But I've searched for answers in enough investing subs to know that some of you have strong opinions on gold, and you'll share them regardless of the question asked :p I'll add a comment with my specifc position in the comments so you guys have something to work with. 

**The Actual Question(s)**

The bits of information I've run into suggest gold might be a bit more complicated than I thought. The only basic assumption I'm working on at the moment is ""no matter how absurd something gets, it will probably get more insane soon."" I haven't been wrong in this assumption yet.

1) EFTs vs Gold: I'm aware of the liquidity difference, and that EFTs can become partially detached from the spot price. I also know some EFTs are backed by bullion, and offer to convert to bullion if desired. Some are backed by miners and various mints - for these last two, what are the risks/rewards of bullion vs efts? Can these efts still decouple from the spot price? Under what conditions would that happen? This is complicated by most EFTs have amortisation built into their conversions.

2) I just learned of the gold futures market, and more importantly that it might have poor structural integrity. My research shows that the situation got flagged a few years ago, but I haven't found much follow-up info from reputable sources. Did this end up getting resolved, or is it still a house of cards? If it came tumbling, will it take the spot price with it?

3) More recently, there's been a revival of the speculation on the holdings of  Fort Knox. My assumption is that if it's found to be empty, this would mean less gold in the world than thought and the price would rise in response. It seems like I have that wrong though? I'm not American so I'm not sure what the interaction is between Fort Knox and everything else.

4) Depending on your attitude towards the absurdity of the universe, and whether the powers that be are accelerationists, there is a non-zero chance the US might try to return to the gold standard. Is this economic suicide? Yes. But let's pretend it happens - I would assume this shoots the value through the roof. But I feel like I'm missing something or that it's not that straight forward. Does anyone have thoughts?

5) any other factors I should be aware of?

I made some mistakes in options trading in 2020, which resulted in a short-term loss of about $130K. I learned from my mistakes, and fortunately, I was able to secure a well-paying job in 2021. Since then, I have saved up about $300K.

I now focus on long-term investments by buying and holding shares (VOO, VTI, SCHD, top tech companies, etc.). However, I have not invested the $300K in stocks because I plan to buy a house within the next couple of years and need that money for a down payment, potential renovations, and settling in. To ensure safe and guaranteed returns, and to avoid state tax on the gains, I have been investing that money in T-Bills. Last year, I earned about $15K in interest (received a 1099-INT) from T-Bills.

While talking to a friend, I learned that if I sell T-Bills before their maturity, the gains will not be classified as interest income (1099-INT) but rather as capital gains, which can be offset against my past losses. For example, if my T-Bill matures on 6/30/2025, but I sell it on 6/25/2025 (before maturity), the gain would be treated as a capital gain rather than interest income.

Since filing my 2021 taxes, I have been deducting $3K per year from my past losses, as allowed by the IRS, and I still have $115K in carryover losses.

Additionally, I have not sold any of the vested shares I received over the past two years, and they have gained approximately 15% (\~$25K).

# My Questions:

1. Would selling T-Bills before maturity be a good strategy to offset my carryover losses?
2. When I sell my vested RSUs (which may have both long-term and short-term gains), or the shares, will I be able to offset the gains with my remaining carryover losses?

If so:

1. Which timeframes do you find most useful? (50-day, 200-day, something else?)

1. Do you use crossovers, or just the relative position to the MA?

1. Have you found it actually improves your returns?

Paying down mortgage early is a better investment,1j0u583,Apprehensive_Two1528,2025-03-01 02:32:31,252,0.81,152,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j0u583/half_a_year_looking_back_paying_down_mortgage/,"Just so you know, half a year ago, I was debating if I shall pay down my 7.785% mortgage or shall Ininvest that money in the stock market.

Most redittors suggest paying off, I wanted to invest that money.

So I did half and half. I paid down half of the balance and left half.

The half balance I invested generated (4% to 14%) return on paper. 8% is kinda the median return after half a year. considering the tax benefit of carrying a mortgage, I‘d say paying down the mortagage is a better investment. the cut off is around 7%. So if your mortgage is 7% or lower, you shall invest, but if your mortage is 7% or higher, you shall pay it off. It’s a magical arbitrary number that worked for me.

FYI

  
Edit 03/01

6 month return is cumulative, not annualized. so if next 6 month’s stock market is gonna performing similarly, the half balance invested in stock market would generate a 8% to 28% annual return, median 15% ish. but no one has a crystal ball. I’d think paying down is still the best bet, considering how volatile the market is this year. ",0,,2025-03-01,0.4404,0.8331,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.538575,0.0,0.2692875,63.464375,positive

Based on this, are there any statistics on general stock market participation? Maybe as a proxy is there any way to see the increase of people investing into diversified funds?

""Wharton professor, Jeremy Siegel, analyzed stock and bond returns in his classic book, ""Stocks for the Long Run"" (6th edition 2022). His research goes all the way back to 1802 (the very long run indeed) and concludes, not surprisingly, that over one and two-year periods stocks are much riskier than bonds. But across every 5-vear holding period since 1802, the worst performance for stocks, at -11.9%, was only slightly worse than the worst performance for bonds, -10.1%. (Incidentally, the best rolling 5-year period for stocks was +27.3% per year whereas the best for bonds was 17.7%/ yr). For every 10-vear holding period, again going back to 1802, the worst stock performance, -4%/yr, has actually been better than the worst bond performance, -5.4%/yr. (The best rolling 10-year period for stocks was +16.8%/yr; the best for bonds, 12.4%/yr). And across every 20-vear holding period stock returns were positive every single time, the worst being growth per year of +1.0%. The worst 20-year period for bonds was -3.1/yr. (The best rolling 20-year period for stocks was +12.6%/yr, and the best for bonds was 8.8%). Making these figures look even better is the fact that all of these percentages are real returns after inflation.

Siegel sums it up as follows (our emphasis added): ""The probability that bonds and savings accounts have frequently outperformed stocks in the short run is the primary reason why it is so difficult for many investors to stay in stocks. But it is very significant that in the more than two-century history of financial returns, stocks, in contrast to bonds, have never delivered a negative real return over periods as short as 17 years. Although it might appear to be riskier to accumulate wealth in stocks rather than in bonds over long periods of time, for the preservation of purchasing power, precisely the opposite is true: the safest long-term investment has clearly been a diversified portfolio of equities.""",0,,2025-02-28,0.0,0.9646,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.24115,0.0,0.120575,56.02875,positive

The Atlanta Federal Reserve is projecting a contraction of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.5 percent in the first quarter, flashing a warning sign for the U.S. economy.

The projection is a significant shift for the Atlanta Fed over the last few weeks that comes a little more than a month after President Trump took office.

The Atlanta Fed last week was predicting 2.3 percent positive growth for the first quarter. A month ago, it was registering 3.9 percent growth.

The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow measure is not an official forecast but rather a running estimate of real GDP growth based on data as it comes in.

The first quarter ends at the end of March, and GDP will be officially calculated by the Commerce Department.

But the forward-looking indicator’s major drop will still be of significant concern to policymakers, economists and markets alike, especially as fourth-quarter GDP registered a strong second estimate this week.

GDP from October to December came in at a healthy annualized rate of 2.3 percent, as reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday.

I would say I'm familiar with the basics of investing. The majority of my portfolio is in VWCE because I'm not a professional investor (and even if I were, VWCE would probably outperform me in the long run). I will still allocate most of my investment funds to VWCE.

However, over the past two years, I've invested a portion of my money (money I was willing to lose) in stocks of companies I personally selected, and it has really paid off for me (at least so far). I believe I was able to accurately assess the investment opportunity because I work in that industry and immediately ""saw"" that a particular investment made sense.

Since investing isn't my full-time job, I'm wondering **if you have any recommendations on where I can get information on potential investment opportunities?** In other words, I'm looking for a website, forum, subreddit, or Substack—anything written by credible authors who are successful investors (those who have consistently outperformed VWCE) and who offer their suggestions on where to invest. Of course, I will focus on investing only in companies that align with my industry or where I clearly understand, based on my own experience, why the investment makes sense, even if I don't directly work in that field.

I think the better way to compare would be the property's value plus the cost of a remodel vs what kind of return that could generate. For example, say the remodel is 80-120k and it could sell for 150k as is or for 350k fixed up and rent would be 2600. The remodel would be worth doing so to rent it the ""cost"" would be 450k and after expenses rental income would be like 23k so that would be 5% return which is comperable to a conservative allocation.

investing,Move some $$ out of U.S Index funds and into foreign ETF’s ?,1j08dlv,paragonx29,2025-02-28 09:03:24,22,0.66,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j08dlv/move_some_out_of_us_index_funds_and_into_foreign/,"Hi all, I’m thinking about selling off $25K of U.S. index funds in a 350,000 portfolio to hedge again recessionary factors, fears over tariffs, etc…we’ve seen how the market has performed in the last week.  I am not panicking wide-scale, but I have lost about 10% in my overall portfolio and 50k in just the last week alone.  I know that is not a lot for some folks, but it is to me and I’m getting a bit more concerned if this trend continues.

With this in mind – again was going to take 25k out of the index funds and place in the following:

11k: **Coca-Cola**, I know it’s a U.S. equity but it seems recession-proof and W. Buffet says it’s a stock he will never sell from his portfolio.  Obviously has foreign exposure too.  Pays about .50 dividend/qtr.

9k: **DXJ:** Japan ETF which invests in all of the large Japanese CO’s with their associated divi’s. Hedges against instability vs. U.S. dollar as well and other factors.  Buffet has also been recently moving $$ into Japan’s market.

5K: **EUAD**: European-defense and Aerospace ETF: holds Rolls-Royce at about 12% which seems to be a darling of the market lately.

I mention the Divi’s only in passing for awareness, performance is more important to and to hedge against U.S. instability at the moment (hopefully not next 3-4 years).  Again most of my $$ stays in the U.S. market – I just wanted to see what others thought of this plan.  

The 2 ETF’s are rated as 5\* by Morningstar and you can look more into their yearly/historical splits which have been good.

Thanks.

As of February 27, 2025, it closed at 43,239.50, down 0.4% for the day. 
In contrast, the S&P 500 fell 1.6% to 5,861.57, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.8% to 18,544.42. 

These declines followed President Trump's announcement of new tariffs: 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and an increase to 20% on Chinese products, set to take effect in March and April.

Beneath the surface, cracks are forming. The recent market downturn is attributed to fading AI hype, persistent inflation, and looming economic uncertainty. Notably, Nvidia shares plunged 8.5% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings, signaling waning enthusiasm in the tech sector.

Adding to the concern, the CNN Fear & Greed Index has plummeted to 21, indicating ""extreme fear"" among investors. Historically, such levels of fear have been associated with market bottoms, suggesting a potential for a rebound.

investing,Can Algorithmic Investing Reduce Emotional Bias and Improve Long-Term Wealth Growth?,1j054e8,Calm_Comparison_713,2025-02-28 06:00:10,3,0.62,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j054e8/can_algorithmic_investing_reduce_emotional_bias/,"Many investors struggle with emotional decision-making—buying high in excitement and selling low out of fear. Studies show that the average investor underperforms the market by nearly 4 percent per year due to panic selling and overtrading.

But what if investing was automated, rule-based, and optimized for long-term growth?

# The Concept of Algorithmic Investing

Instead of relying on emotions, algorithmic investing follows predefined, data-driven strategies to manage portfolios. It is not about day trading or chasing short-term profits but creating a structured, disciplined, and automated investing approach for sustainable wealth growth.

# How It Works

* **Passive Investing Automation** – Set rules for periodic investments (ETFs, Index Funds, SIPs) and let automation handle execution.
* **Portfolio Rebalancing** – Automatically adjust asset allocation based on market conditions.
* **Risk Management and Hedging** – Use strategies like stop-loss automation or options hedging to protect capital.
* **Tax-Efficient Investing** – Optimize tax harvesting to minimize liabilities.
* **Hybrid Investing and Trading Strategies** – Balance long-term investing with short-term tactical adjustments.

# The Key Benefits

* **Removes Emotional Bias** – No impulsive buying or panic selling.
* **Rule-Based, Data-Driven** – Every move is backed by logic, not speculation.
* **Works Round the Clock** – Unlike human investors, algorithms do not get tired.
* **Customizable Strategies** – Investors can create, adapt, or even monetize their strategies.

# What I Want to Know

I am curious about the investing community’s thoughts on algorithmic investing for long-term wealth building rather than short-term trading.

* Do you think automation can improve long-term investing results?
* What risks or challenges do you see in trusting an algorithm over human judgment?
* Would you personally use an algorithmic strategy for investing, or do you prefer hands-on control?

Looking forward to the discussion.

investing,$SANA - Biotechnology company poised to bounce back,1j029q6,PureImbalance,2025-02-28 02:28:46,14,0.73,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j029q6/sana_biotechnology_company_poised_to_bounce_back/,"**TL,DR:** Monday SANA Biotechnology will present 8 week interim analysis from their clinical trial curing diabetes, at 4 weeks it was perfect and spiked the stock to 7$, similar will occur Monday/Tuesday and at the 12 weeks analysis results at their earnings call March 23rd. 

Background: I'm a biotechnologist with a PhD in Immunology (but only from France so what the fuck do I know) and I mostly play biotech companies.

SANA Biotechnology was overhyped as fuck when they IPO'd, so everybody and their grandma gave them a nice cash cushion which they blasted through for a couple years. What did they get? Well I'll tell you what they got now.

They have a cell engineering platform which lets them turn cells into pancreatic beta islets, the cells that naturally react to your blood sugar and regulate it via secretion of insulin, and they have a ""hypoimmune"" platform which knocks out the receptors for both T and NK cells so that these cells do not get attacked by the adaptive immune response, meaning they can mass produce pancreatic beta islets for transplantation into people. Nice in theory, so what can you use this for?

Well, it cures diabetes by a single injection depositing the cells under a belly muscle. How well does it work? They cured diabetic mice for at least 14 months, and they cured a diabetic monkey for 6 months before intentionally killing the cells. And, most importantly, in November of last year, they started their first phase I clinical trial in Sweden, with a single participant so far. [On January 7th, they presented the first analysis 4 weeks after injection](https://ir.sana.com/static-files/33b2aa85-6fb6-47cf-baa5-f97b587c8227), showing that their cells survive and are indeed not rejected by the immune system. This caused the stock to briefly spike from 1.7$ to 7.3$ before settling again and trending down over the past month again. But here's the thing - we know already that the treatment works in monkey and mouse for longer term, and as an immunologist I can tell you that if they aren't rejected after 4 weeks they likely won't be rejected after 8 or 12 weeks either, especially when it worked that way in monkeys.

SANA is presenting their interim analysis of 8 weeks on Monday , and I am expecting the results to confirm that their treatment continues to work, and they will be the first US company to cure diabetes this way. Another reason why I am confident this will work is that the Chinese have already done it ([but without hypoimmune platform, they just inject beta-islets with immunosuppression](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01022-5)). On their earnings call (March 23rd) they will present the 3 months interim analysis and everybody will want to get in on this technology.

Last September, they were sitting on 200 Million in cash after losing 60 million per quarter, no debt, they expect their cash to last through 2026. The current results, if as positive as I expect them to be, will give them enough leverage to raise more cash in the mid-term and survive long enough to fulfill the hype of their IPO.

The bear case? They run out of cash and get bought up for cents on the dollar and all the profits go to who buys them. Alternatively, in 6 months the cells grow into a tumor and their killswitch antibody doesn't work and now the patients have a hypoimmune tumor, company goes bankrupt from getting sued. I'm willing to bet that doesn't happen.

Microsoft (MSFT) is maintaining its market leadership worth nearly $2.96 trillion. The market cap of its stocks is currently $2.96 trillion, currently trading at $402.85, reflecting its stable and firm trend over this year, ranging between $385.58 and $468.35 during a 52-week trading. While there have been minute movements in its stocks, its trend in total is generally sideways. Financially, Microsoft performed well in FY 2024, with its revenues improving 15.7% yearly, amounting to $245.1 billion, and earnings improving 21.8% to stand at $88.1 billion. The company’s consistent numbers support its growth prospects in its business divisions. Despite the challenges of escalating capital investment and increasing competition in AI, Microsoft's strategic investment in AI and cloud continues to drive growth. They are well positioned for stability in the long term and success in the future in a transforming technology landscape due to their investment in AI solutions, business solutions, and growth in the cloud.

Microsoft’s collaboration with AI models will offer the company tremendous growth in the near future. Since the explosion of AI, the Microsoft Azure program has become invaluable to other enterprises looking to integrate AI into their platforms. The high quality of Azure’s programs is a massive growth driver for MSFT. It has experienced a YoY revenue growth of 31%, which is over 3 percent above the predicted 5-year CAGR of AI models. Microsoft Cloud itself also experienced a notable 21% YoY increase in revenue and 12% growth in revenue in Q2. In January of this year, MSFT gained permission to add the Open AI model to their neural network, Copilot. These companies’ collaboration takes advantage of the $13B revenue run rate (predicting future revenue based on a company’s current revenue) of AI models and their YoY growth of 157%–175%. MSFT’s AI programs will gain huge amounts of revenue from the 345 million users using its services.

Microsoft is making a massive investment in its future, expecting to spend around $80 billion on capital expenditures this year - nearly double what it spent just a couple of years ago ($44–$55 billion). Most of this money is going toward building AI-powered data centers and expanding its cloud infrastructure, ensuring the company stays ahead in the rapidly evolving tech space. In the short term, this aggressive spending is putting pressure on free cash flow (FCF), which was about $70 billion over the past year and even saw a 29% drop year-over-year in Q2 FY25. But Microsoft is playing the long game—by fiscal 2026, FCF is expected to recover to $82.38 billion as these investments start paying off. This is a familiar playbook for Microsoft, much like when it bet big on cloud computing years ago. The short-term financial squeeze is real, but the payoff could be enormous, setting Microsoft up for 15+ years of sustained growth and solidifying its position as a leader in AI and cloud computing.

In terms of current valuation metrics, Microsoft's current stock price as of February 1st, 2025, is 121.95, and the forward P/E ratio is 33.4x. Additionally, its expected earnings per share (EPS) for Fiscal Year 2026 is $15.04, as well as a 12-month target price of $490, based on earnings growth and valuation expectations. In terms of projected price target calculations, the standard valuation formula is used, and via the given EPS for 2026 and P/E ratio, it is projected that the stock price by the end of fiscal 2026 will be approximately $500. This, however, is under the pretext that Microsoft maintains a P/E ratio of 33.4x. Stock valuation fluctuates based on market conditions; thus, if the market decides that Microsoft deserves a lower valuation, for instance, a P/E ratio of 30 instead of 33.4, the target price would change, falling to around $451. This suggests that if Microsoft’s stock trades at a more conservative multiplier, the price might be closer to $451 instead of $500. Microsoft's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is at 13.3%, meaning that Microsoft's stock would be growing at a healthily above-average rate compared to the broader market. Microsoft's cloud computing (Azure) and AI services are key growth drivers as AI-related revenue is projected to exceed $10 billion annually, growing at 175% year-over-year. The growth of overall revenue, at approximately 12-13% per year, supports earnings growth. The growth margins are expected to be 68-70% in FY 2025 and FY 2026, indicating profitability, and the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is expected to exceed $65 billion in FY 2025 and $72 billion in FY 2026, meaning that Microsoft has money to reinvest or return to shareholders. However, risks include the fact that their valuation relies heavily on AI expansion; therefore, if AI adoption slows, the stock might not meet growth targets. Additionally, a declining P/E ratio could bring the price closer to $431 instead of $500. Competition also plays a key role, as rivals such as Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) are also growing their AI and cloud businesses, which could impact Microsoft's market share and interest rates. Finally, economic conditions influence investor sentiment, ultimately affecting stock valuation. Overall, Microsoft remains a strong investment, but future performance depends on AI adoption, earnings growth, and maintaining investor confidence.

Microsoft integrates security into its cloud and AI strategy with a Zero Trust approach, AI-driven threat intelligence, and a unified security platform. Its key security solutions include Microsoft Defender, an AI-powered XDR for endpoints, cloud, and email; Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR for real-time threat detection; and Microsoft Entra, an IAM solution with multi-factor authentication, conditional access, and identity governance. Microsoft’s cybersecurity business is rapidly growing, generating over $20 billion annually at a double-digit rate, serving 785,000+ customers, and investing $1 billion+ annually in security research and development. AI-driven security processes 65 trillion signals daily, enabling real-time threat mitigation. This robust security framework strengthens Azure adoption, AI deployments, and enterprise trust, making security a growth driver rather than an add-on. By embedding security across its cloud ecosystem, Microsoft reinforces its leadership in cybersecurity while accelerating Azure and AI innovation.

TL;DR: Microsoft maintains market leadership with a stable stock price, driven by AI and cloud growth. Heavy CapEx investment impacts short-term cash flow but positions the company for long-term gains. Valuation suggests a price target of \~$500 by FY2026, but risks include free cash flow declines and AI adoption uncertainty. Quantum computing advancements and a strong cybersecurity ecosystem further solidify Microsoft’s market strength.",0,,2025-02-27,0.5267,0.9993,0.0,0.8422279357910156,0.75,0.25,0.6448499999999999,0.2105569839477539,0.4277034919738769,71.38517459869385,positive

* The $1.8 billion Alani Nu acquisition strengthens Celsius’ market position and financial flexibility.
* Post-acquisition, Celsius holds a \~16% market share, competing with Red Bull and Monster (\~30% each).
* Q4 earnings were impacted by PepsiCo inventory corrections but show strong international growth.
* Valuation remains discounted (\~3.5x EV/S) compared to Monster (\~6x EV/S), signaling potential upside.

Celsius is on the verge of a major turnaround in 2025, driven by strategic initiatives aimed at revitalizing growth and market position. After a challenging 2024 marked by supply chain disruptions, inventory mismanagement, and revenue declines, the company has made a decisive move to strengthen its foothold in the energy drink market. The acquisition of Alani Nu, a rapidly growing functional beverage brand, signals a new era of expansion and profitability for Celsius. As a brand that has successfully captured the attention of Gen Z and Millennial consumers through a strong social media presence and health-conscious product offerings, Alani Nu aligns seamlessly with Celsius’ mission to dominate the “better-for-you” energy drink segment. The $1.8 billion deal, executed at a 3x sales multiple, not only enhances Celsius’ revenue potential but also provides a $150 million net tax benefit, bolstering the company’s financial flexibility. Ultimately, this report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Celsius Holdings’ strategic positioning after the Alani Nu acquisition, examining its market competitiveness, financial performance, valuation outlook, and future growth potential.

Alani Nu was founded in 2018 as a female-focused, functional beverage and wellness brand catering to Gen Z and Millennial consumers. Its strong social media-driven marketing strategy allowed it to double its sales in 2024, contributing to rapid market share expansion. Meanwhile, Celsius struggled with a 31% decline in third-quarter revenue due to supply chain disruptions and inventory mismanagement. The $1.8 billion acquisition reflects a strategic effort to strengthen Celsius' position in the energy drink market. With a 3x sales multiple valuation and an expected $150 million net tax benefit, the deal significantly enhances Celsius’ financial outlook and growth trajectory.

Post-acquisition, Celsius commands approximately 16% market share, still trailing industry giants Red Bull and Monster at \~30% each. However, Celsius' focus on zero-sugar, health-conscious beverages positions it to capitalize on growing consumer demand. Acquiring Alani Nu broadens Celsius’ consumer base, particularly among female and millennial consumers. The deal is expected to yield \~$50 million in synergies and open international expansion opportunities, further strengthening Celsius’ ability to compete with market leaders.

Celsius reported Q4 revenue of $332.2 million (a 4.3% Y/Y decrease), surpassing analyst expectations of $326 million. PepsiCo’s inventory corrections negatively impacted sales, leading to a 6% decline in domestic revenue to $312 million. However, international revenue surged 39% to $20 million, reflecting strong global demand. Despite near-term challenges, the company remains fundamentally strong and well-positioned for future growth.

Celsius’ current valuation (\~3.5x EV/S) is significantly lower than Monster’s (\~6x EV/S), making it an attractive investment opportunity. Historically, Celsius traded at \~8x EV/S, and with projected 2025 revenue exceeding $1.6 billion, the company is positioned for a strong recovery. The Alani Nu acquisition is expected to be a major growth driver, unlocking significant revenue potential and enhancing overall market positioning.

Key risks include execution challenges related to integrating Alani Nu, competition from entrenched players like Red Bull and Monster, and evolving consumer preferences in the energy drink sector. Global expansion presents both opportunities and obstacles, including regulatory hurdles, supply chain complexities, and marketing adaptation to diverse consumer bases. Successfully addressing these risks is critical for Celsius to sustain its growth momentum.

Celsius plans to leverage Alani Nu’s brand recognition for international market penetration, targeting key regions such as Europe (UK, Germany, Netherlands), Asia (China, Japan, South Korea), and Latin America (Brazil, Mexico). Challenges include regulatory compliance, supply chain logistics, and marketing adaptation. The PepsiCo partnership offers a significant advantage, providing access to a well-established global distribution network that can accelerate growth.

Investor reactions to the Alani Nu acquisition and earnings report have been highly positive, driving a 20% stock rally post-announcement. Celsius’ valuation discount compared to Monster presents a potential upside for investors who believe in its long-term growth. While Monster remains the market leader, Celsius' rapid expansion and strategic moves position it as a high-growth challenger.

The energy drink industry is growing rapidly, with a projected US market value of $50.8 billion by 2033 (8.3% CAGR). Consumers increasingly prefer natural ingredients and functional benefits, favoring Celsius' health-conscious offerings. Competitors like Monster and PepsiCo are expanding their functional drink lines, reinforcing the need for Celsius to sustain innovation and retail expansion while managing rising competition.

Beyond the Alani Nu acquisition, Celsius plans to sustain growth through product innovation and new market segments. Balancing aggressive expansion with profitability will be key, as leadership navigates challenges in an evolving industry. Potential new product lines and targeted market entries could further strengthen its competitive position.

Red Bull and Monster dominate the market, but Celsius differentiates itself with a strong health-conscious brand. The Alani Nu acquisition is expected to increase Celsius’ market share to \~16%. The PepsiCo partnership is crucial for distribution expansion and accelerated market penetration. Through strategic acquisitions, branding, and partnerships, Celsius is positioned for long-term industry leadership.

Celsius Holdings is poised for a strong comeback in 2025, driven by its $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu. This move strengthens its market position, expands its consumer base, and enhances financial flexibility with a $150 million net tax benefit. While execution risks and competitive pressures remain, the company’s strategic initiatives, global expansion plans, and strong investor sentiment suggest significant upside potential. Celsius remains an attractive investment for those betting on its long-term success.

**TL;DR:** Celsius Holdings is set for a major rebound in 2025, fueled by the $1.8 billion Alani Nu acquisition. This strategic move strengthens market positioning, expands the consumer base, and enhances financial flexibility. While risks remain, strong investor sentiment, valuation upside, and global expansion plans suggest Celsius is a compelling growth opportunity.

The repayments were going as planned, and I found another favorite neighborhood business, one whose owners I knew personally and trusted, and put in on a second investment that ended up being repaid early. At that point, I had a false sense of confidence, and also was very excited about the mission of the businesses that they were looking to promote, and added six others to my portfolio for a total of 15k in principal minus the others that I had already invested in.

1. Microsoft

2. Amazon Web Services 

3. Google 

I’m not personally invested in Nvidia. To Nvidia investors:

Does hearing that such a substantial portion of revenue is concentrated in 3 customers worry you? 

I know very little about the industry. I’ve heard, however, that both Amazon and Google are creating their own custom chips. If they scale up their chip-making operations, it could lead to needing to purchase less GPU’s from Nvidia. 

Also, making up such a large part of sales, doesn’t this give them increased bargaining power? It would seem that these companies are in a position of leverage to negotiate better pricing from Nvidia, which could reduce margins. 

Lastly, there’s a question of competition. Again, I don’t know much, but it seems that Intel and AMD are aggressively improving their AI hardware offerings. If they gain market share, Nvidia’s largest customers could look to start diversifying their suppliers. 

I’d love to get the Nvidia investors perspective on such a large part of revenues being concentrated in 3 customers. ",0,,2025-02-27,0.0,0.9528,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.2382,0.0,0.1191,55.955,positive

First off, let’s realize that MSTR has been labeled as a “leveraged BTC play”

I’m here to show you why it is most certainly not.

If we look at its NAV as of today:

Total BTC: 499,096 x ~$86,000 (avg BTC acquisition price)

≈ $42 billion

Now let’s subtract debt and preferred stock

≈ $9 billion in total

Subtracting the debt MSTR has a value of about:

≈ $33 billion

Now let’s take that $33 billion and compare it to its original cost basis on all of its bitcoin purchases thus far:

499,096 BTC at an avg of $66,357

499,096 x 66,357 

… ≈ $33 billion

Now last time I checked, if we spent a total of ~$33 billion on BTC and now have a current value in BTC of about ~33 billion after considering debt… we made a 0% return!

Effectively this strategy has yielded a net of about 0$ at the current price of BTC…

(Obviously numbers were rounded here)

If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?

Over the last 2 years they have not had to dip into their retirment accounts and have comfortably lived on the SSI and government pension.

I also ha e the option of rolling to a beneficiary IRA which seems kind of like both worlds but so far, at least with who I have talked to.  I could choose to have 2.5% fee applied at the front to ha e it in brokerage or could have 1% removed annually to ha e it actively managed.

I wanted to diversify my portgolio and get more CHF as I like it as a ""safe currency"". So I was looking about which Swiss companies I could invest in and I must say I'm not very knowledgeable.  
I currently own SREN for a couple years already, around 40% up. I wonder if I should sell and take profit or keep holding, but as dividends are nice I'm leaning towards holding.

Except that I noted CMBN and SQN in the banking sector. While I'm confident about future for both SQN bumped so hard already that it's maybe not a good buy timing.

On the losers side I found STGN and LEHN while in the red I think both companies are still resourceful and may go up again, so should I consider it a stock sale or is it highway to hell ?

Lastly, for the sake of diversification I looked towards different sectors and found PSPN, DKSH and COTN which may look interesting imho.

But as I said I'm not very knowledgeable so if anyone has more insight than me about the market please share your thoughts.

investing,Self managed traditional IRA account with many small positions,1iyyq9q,speedlever,2025-02-26 16:24:31,1,0.6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iyyq9q/self_managed_traditional_ira_account_with_many/,"About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.

Would it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. 

I'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. 

For the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts.

I'm fully aware you should never use credit to invest. But here is the situation I have. 

I have recently been investing with a real estate broker for a percentage return in real estate. I wanted to test the waters so I invested 25k into a project which was 9% stake in the property. After the project was completed, the property was refinanced, I got my 25k initial investment back and now I receive 9% of the monthly rent as well as 9% equity in the property. The turn around was about 6 months to get my initial 25k back. I am now receiving about $250/month in rent and I literally have to do nothing. The total project cost was 260k and appraised at 340k so on top of the rent I also have 7k in equity with the property, which I have the option to sell to another investor in the property or just hold out. The brokerage handles all property management, repairs, etc. I never have to come out of pocket again. This is all written in our signed contract. If a unit is vacant, my monthly amount goes down, but I am not responsible at all for any mortgage, bills, etc. Again this is all outlined in the contract. 


Now I have approximately 40k available to use as a balance transfer at a .09% rate with a 5% transfer fee for 16 months. I can get the transfer deposited straight to my account in cash. I don't plan on using the entire amount, but would it be a good idea to use a portion of that to reinvest that way I can retain some capital in a HYSA or CD. I understand there's always the risk of the project going over budget, which would be spread throughout all the investors, or something bad happening. But this brokerage has shown evidence of multiple successful projects. Just to confirm I would 100% have the capital available to pay off the card in full if something were to come up. I wouldn't be taking out money I didn't have.

Your uncle John is more of a character. He has a spinner he has created which has 40 slots on it, each of which has a different dollar amount, ranging from -$2500 to $2500.

Uncle John says that he'll spin the spinner once per year for at least 20 years and whatever amount comes up is what happens that year.

1. Students aren’t comfortable with answers generated by a single model. Chegg addresses this by providing answers from multiple models. They are adopting AI, and Chegg’s subscription fee is similar to that of a paid service like ChatGPT.

2. CHGG owns Busuu, a language-learning app. Highly regarded, it is now generating revenue as it grows in popularity and through partnerships with enterprises.

3. CHGG is still avoiding losses despite a significant drop in traffic, excluding one-off expenses. Service businesses are generally more adaptable and flexible in this regard, and Chegg’s cost-cutting initiatives are proving to be effective.

4. CHGG is likely to be acquired, as many businesses could integrate it into their portfolios. It has significant potential in the education industry and could leverage its Busuu language-learning app to expand into online courses.

5. CHGG has no history of share dilution in fact they are more interested in buybacks. Over the last 5 years Cheggs outstanding shares have dropped by over 20%. At a 100m$ valuation- they will be more interested now than ever before.

6. CHGG’s litigation over Google AIO, if turns out to be favourable will be advantageous.

investing,Here’s my theory on why everyone should be buying Bitcoin.,1iyfh9d,fhltnt,2025-02-25 23:42:24,0,0.24,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iyfh9d/heres_my_theory_on_why_everyone_should_be_buying/,"First off, I’m not saying to go all in and only buy bitcoin. Obviously you should have a diversified portfolio of stocks and ETFs too. But I’m going to argue why everyone should be buying bitcoin. Personally I just dollar cost average and buy the same amount every month and sometimes double it if there is a big drop.

My theory is based on the de-Americanization of the world and the probable removal of the dollar as the world reserve currency and the end of the petrodollar. Trump seems to be accelerating this process but the trends have been there for a while. It’s impossible for me to guess when this will happen but my theory is more based on the world being on that path.

BRICS is clearly a big part of this. I think this is what could most likely lead to the end of the petrodollar. They seem interested in creating a competitor to the dollar and trading oil in a different currency would be a good way to start.

I think we’ll start seeing a major reduction in the foreign appetite for US debt as the total rises. The other threat here is a devaluation of the dollar if the government decides to print more to pay the interest. That weakens the argument that the dollar should be the world reserve currency.

Brentton Woods is dead officially since Nixon. So I feel like the contract struck is dead too. It’s just a matter of time until other countries call us out on this.

I think when that really happens will be determined by the rate at which our military degrades. I think the real reason the world accepts the US financial domination of the dollar is that we enforce the ability to have international trade on the oceans.

Most international trade happens by sea. 90% by volume and 70-80% by value. This is only possible because the US has been the police of the sea since World War 2. No other country had the financial and military capability. And our war build up meant that for the first time we could. That is the macro economic paradigm we have existed in for 85 years.

This is also becoming less and less true. The Cold War saw the USSR and now Russia begin to challenge the US in oceans. They obviously can’t dominate the US but they can compete. More recently China has made major advancements. One example is the massive amphibious ship they just unveiled. This means we are moving from a uni-polar world to a multi-polar world. This makes the removal of the dollar as world reserve currency possible.

Africa unifying under an African currency is also an interesting idea but I don’t know enough about it to comment. But if it did happen it would be a big deal and a major move in that direction.

What does this mean for Bitcoin?
I think this is where the idea of Bitcoin being digital gold comes in. Bitcoin is known by most people in the world now. We’re seeing institutional and some national recognition. So there is already some “belief in its value”. We’ve already seen it be valuable to some people. I think when the dollar is no longer the world reserve currency and this fake idea of being pegged to physical value in Fort Knox ceases to exist other countries will choose not to peg their currencies to gold again. I think leaders are addicted to floating currencies at this point. I think a lot of countries will eventually opt to peg their own digital current to bitcoin because it already “has value” in the minds of the public and probably will even by that point.

I do think the price of bitcoin will need to stabilize to a degree for this to happen. But that’s a different subject. Mass adoption, regulation, and decreased mining could contribute.",0,,2025-02-25,0.0,-0.9063,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,-0.226575,0.0,-0.1132875,44.335625,negative

Now the strategy could take time to play out, but when AI continues to grow, electricity demand will increase and they will be the ones setting the rates. (Data centers consume something like 2% of global electricity) 

Also, if we head into a period of market turmoil, they act as defensive plays that normally weather downturns, since people always need gas and electricity. 

Rates rising is the specter haunting this strategy of course. If inflation continues to rise and takes rates with it, debt payments will increase and utility profitability will suffer. 

Other than rates rising, this seems like a win-win scenario to me. On the one hand, you have utility stocks benefiting from AI electricity demand, and on the other hand, you have a portfolio of companies that pay high dividends and have a track record of weathering downturns.

This market is still euphoric - I guarantee many analysts have not been phased by the deep seek news - after this news every single person should have become skeptical of using forward p/e or as mentioned on Bloomberg “p/e”. 

What is trailing p/e vs forward p/e?

p/e represents the multiple that investors pay for each $ of company earnings

Trailing uses last years REAL earnings, for NVDA this is at ~50 (currently about +10 or more higher than all other stocks besides Tesla- which btw is still just a car company- check their income statement. 

Forward uses PROJECTED EARNINGS - this is your 30 p/e and if you’re no skeptical about this after the deep seek news

EUPHORIA

Edit: because some users seem to think I would never at any time buy a growth stocks based on this theory…

I 100% would buy growth stocks- in fact, I own some NVDA through ETFs and have owned even more up until very recently. My argument is that much of the calculation of forward p/e that makes NVDA seem relatively “cheap” at 30 is made up on high expectations that were pricing in immense amounts of demand that even without the deep seek news needed to be near perfect yet now we have all this macro news on top of that to make the risk higher.

I can go further by saying the market is as levered as it’s ever been with margin accounts accruing debits nearly surpassing the post-Covid inflation money printing bubble.

   * 50% in my checking account
* **RRSP:**

The portfolio is intended for long-term growth with exposure to Canadian, US, developed, and emerging markets. I know I’m heavily tilted toward the US market right now, but I’m evaluating the risk and if needed will consider reallocation. 

I trust this community to know what they’re doing, so I’m here for advice. Does this portfolio look reasonable? Should I tweak my allocations, or am I missing something important?

investing,This sub is too sold on DCA and hold.,1iy5uvt,GlobalAttempt,2025-02-25 16:06:55,0,0.28,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iy5uvt/this_sub_is_too_sold_on_dca_and_hold/,"The amount of people that push this is astounding to me.  Yes, it's historically been a valid strategy if your horizon is 30 years plus, but there's not many that can reliably say they won't need to tap their assets over that period.  There are spans of time in the not so recent past that would have you losing so much money that DCA and hold might delay your first home purchase more than 10 years.  Or if you had to unexpectedly raise a kid (happens to the best of us) having to sell when down to meet care expenses.  It's also true that past performance isn't indicative of future; and in my opinion this is more true now than ever.  The structure of our economy, the global economy, the strength of the dollar, and political stability are all shifting.  There are many scenarios that could put us into a long-term sideways market.

Outside of a 401k with retirement many years away or if you just so happen to be a lucky trust fund baby, I don't think it's a great idea.  Life is likely to throw stuff at you where you'll want or need to mobilize your money and it would suck hard to miss those moments or struggle through them because the market isn't doing well.

In a way, the amount of people in the retail market that think they can just ignore risk due to long term trends is what has me the most spooked about current valuations.  That's the kind of sentiment that makes especially nasty bubbles; when buyer sentiment is detached from risk valuations exceed rational and it doesn't take much to panic the herd.  There's quite a few similarities to the current market and the dot com market.  Look at what DCA'ing and holding would have done for you if you started in '97 and wanted to buy a house in 2010.  Congratulations, your strategy would of had you renting an apartment until your 40.

Stocks are a great investment in all but also planning for major events in your life and adjusting your risk exposure accordingly matters.  Blindly DCA and holding 100% something like QQQ is probably inappropriate for the vast majority of investors.

investing,Palantir at $87: Why This Dip Is a Golden Buying Opportunity,1ixy4vz,Goatofoptions,2025-02-25 10:50:36,0,0.26,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ixy4vz/palantir_at_87_why_this_dip_is_a_golden_buying/,"* Palantir Technologies Inc. saw its stock plummet recently, falling to $87 per share after a wave of market jitters tied to CEO Alex Karp’s planned share sale and whispers of Pentagon budget cuts.
* The market’s response seems exaggerated, with Karp’s sale being a scaled-back plan and defense cuts potentially favoring Palantir’s strategic focus amid shifting priorities.
* Palantir’s robust fundamentals—AI leadership, growing government contracts, and commercial expansion—make this pullback an enticing entry point for investors with a mid-to-long-term horizon.
* This dip offers a chance to buy into a company poised to benefit from increased IT spending and its ties to influential figures like Elon Musk.

As of today, February 25, 2025, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) has taken a hit, with its stock price sliding to $87 per share following a turbulent week. The drop kicked off after news broke of CEO Alex Karp’s intent to offload up to 9.975 million shares over the next six months, a move that could net him over $867 million at current prices. This came via a regulatory filing, though it’s worth noting he scrapped an earlier, heftier plan to sell nearly 49 million shares—context that softens the blow despite the initial panic. Then came reports of potential Pentagon budget cuts, with Secretary Pete Hegseth pushing for an 8% annual reduction over five years. Investors flinched, fearing Palantir’s lucrative defense contracts might take a hit. But here’s where I see the disconnect: the cuts target “low-impact” initiatives like diversity programs, not the AI and data analytics Palantir brings to the table. If anything, a realignment toward modernization and missile defense—areas Trump’s administration is prioritizing—could mean more business for Palantir, not less.

The numbers back up the optimism. Palantir’s stock may be down from its peak, but its fundamentals haven’t budged. The company’s leadership in AI-driven solutions, bolstered by its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), keeps it ahead of the curve. Its integration of advanced models like Elon Musk’s Grok from xAI only widens that lead, setting it apart from competitors like Microsoft. Government contracts with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army remain a bedrock, and commercial growth is picking up steam. Posts on X echo this sentiment, with users pointing to Palantir’s free cash flow growth and high margins as signs of a “long-term winner.” Sure, the stock’s valuation isn’t cheap—trading at a forward P/E of around 162 and an EV/Sales multiple far above the sector norm—but quality tech rarely comes at a discount. History shows Palantir’s knack for rebounding from dips, like when it fell from $29 to under $9 between 2021 and 2022, only to roar back as revenue multiples tightened.

Then there’s the Musk factor. Karp’s vocal support for Elon Musk, now heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), ties Palantir to a broader narrative of disruption and efficiency in government spending. Musk’s influence could steer budgets toward tech solutions like Palantir’s, especially as DOGE slashes wasteful contracts—$420 million already axed in its first week. Karp’s praise for Musk as a “builder” and his enthusiasm for “whatever is good for America” signal a synergy that could pay off. Analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives see this sell-off as a chance, holding firm on a $120 price target. Wall Street’s consensus leans cautious, with a mix of hold and sell ratings, but the median price target has climbed to $95—still above today’s $87. For me, this isn’t about next week’s bounce; it’s about 2027 and beyond. Palantir’s role in the AI revolution and its sticky contracts make it a stock worth grabbing while the market’s still wringing its hands.

**TL;DR**: Palantir’s drop to $87 is a buying opportunity. The market overreacted to Karp’s share sale and budget cut fears, but the company’s AI dominance and potential budget wins make it a solid long-term bet.

Despite this, aging homes drive demand for renovations. The company competes against major retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's but aims for growth with new store openings while facing profitability pressures and a high stock valuation. In fiscal 2024, revenue increased slightly by 0.95% with profitability taking hits as well as EPS.

\*I DO NOT own any shares in FND & regularly post about companies that may be of interest to the general community

# Investment Thesis:

FND had yet another challenging year with sales growth of just under 1%. Profitability has taken quite the hit in the past two fiscal years with net income decreasing from $298.2 million in 2022 to $205.87 million in 2024. There has been a 30.9% decline over the two-year period. Macroeconomic challenges continue, including declining consumer affordability.

Additionally, there is a slowdown in new home purchases and starts. [According to the National Association of Home Builders](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/01/housing-starts-end-2024-on-an-up-note), total housing starts for 2024 were 1.36 million, a 3.9% decline from 1.42 million in 2023. These factors have collectively led to softer demand in the home improvement sector. This has had a major effect on FND’s bottom line and future outlook. If there is a turnaround in the flooring industry in the years ahead, Floor & Decor will be a large beneficiary. It will experience increased demand and have the potential to gain market share.

# Key Factors

* **Promising Expansion Potential:** Floor & Decor has set a lofty strategy to target over 500 locations in the long-term from the 251 current stores. By the end of fiscal 2024, FND operates in 38 states. The company plans to open an additional 25 new warehouse stores in fiscal 2025. To support its expansion initiatives, the company has allocated between $330 to $400 million in capital expenditures. Between $200 million to $245 million is designated directly for new store openings. This investment will not only fund the opening of new stores but also the construction of additional distribution centers near Seattle and Baltimore in 2025 and 2026. FND’s expansion strategy to increase their physical presence, investing in infrastructure, and enhancing customer service could help to continue growing their market share against formidable competitors like Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Builders Firstsource.
* **Premium Valuation:** At the time of writing, FND trades with a P/E of 52.19 indicating a massive premium position. While this is nothing new as they have a five-year average P/E of 42.3, this is still a steep asking price to pay. Management has issued fiscal 2025 sales guidance between $4.74 billion to $4.9 billion representing growth between 6.3% and 9.9%. This outlook is seen as a positive development for sales. This is due to management’s expectation to see comparable sales being flat to 3%. Nonetheless, the valuation is excessively rich. The stock declining -14% in the past year is insufficient to justify confidence in future share price appreciation. Sure, the stock generally has maintained its premium label. This is despite tougher conditions and results. Still, the valuation remains too high to confidently buy at $94.27 per share even if they are a well ran company.
* **Tariff Concerns & Threats:** In fiscal 2024, 18% of FND’s products sold were produced in China. As uncertainty persists about future tariffs imposed, FND has taken steps to mitigate disruptions. These include negotiating lower costs from vendors, sourcing from different countries, and increasing retail costs due to inventory costs moving higher. With potential increased costs in the flooring industry, this could dampen consumer spending. It could also dampen housing market activity. Both are crucial for the growth of FND. The company’s performance is closely tied to the health of the housing market. A prolonged slowdown will lead to decreased demand as homeowners may delay renovation projects and new construction may decline as a whole.

# Conclusion

Floor & Decor is a great company with an attractive runway for long-term expansion with a strong balance sheet. However, despite its robust fundamentals, the issue stems from the current valuation. If the stock was trading around a 20-25 P/E, we could confidently recommend a buy. This is despite the secular tailwinds in recent years that continue to suppress profitability and strong earnings growth. With a premium valuation, you should expect strong performance. That simply has not been the case in recent years. Take for example fiscal 2025 expectations, growth between 6.3% and 9.9% does not support a company trading with a P/E of over 50.

Valuation aside, FND still presents a compelling investment opportunity. It has a proven business model and strategic growth initiatives despite the current housing market constraints. They have continued to gain market share against major rivals and have shown a history of great performance. Growth is expected to be its highest in three fiscal years which is a sign that stress is easing. When and if industry factors improve substantially, look for FND to be one of the major beneficiaries of an improving industry.

# Risk Factors:

*  **Interest Rate & Housing Market Sensitivity:** Floor & Decor’s business heavily relies on the residential housing market which is influenced by mortgage rates, home sales, and refinancing activity. Rising interest rates make buying and refinancing homes more expensive reducing home sales and renovation activity. A slowdown in new construction reduced the demand for FND’s flooring materials particularly from professional contractors. If the Federal Reserve maintains high rates for an extended period, FND may experience a decline in revenue growth. This could also affect profitability.
* **Increased Competition:** FND has a specialized advantage in the flooring space. This is due to their overall focus on providing extensive products and materials. Nonetheless, Home Depot and Lowe’s already sell similar items. They could increase their product offering to compete directly with Floor & Decor. Both large companies have major pricing power due to their size and supplier relationships. If they decide to lower flooring prices or offer exclusive deals to contractors, FND could lose market share that they have gained slowly in recent years.",0,,2025-02-25,0.4404,0.9991,0.0,0.8929181694984436,0.75,0.25,0.580075,0.2232295423746109,0.40165227118730545,70.08261355936527,positive

investing,The Bull Case for Xpeng ($XPEV),1ixvmn7,iwannahaveyourbaby,2025-02-25 08:59:51,3,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ixvmn7/the_bull_case_for_xpeng_xpev/,"**Why Xpeng stock ($XPEV) can 5x to hit US$100 (and beyond?) by end-2026**

Below is a condensed report, drop me a PM if you want to know more. Also, if China stocks are not your thing, either risk-, political-, personal-, or other-wise, kindly ignore. I was not paid or sponsored to write this and do not have glowing EV or AI credentials, but I have been diligently researching and studying the EV industry (including Xpeng) since 2020.

**INTRODUCTION**

Xpeng is a Chinese EV maker headed by CEO He Xiaopeng, with dual listings in the USA and Hong Kong. Its current price as of today is around US$19.5 with a market capitalization of around US$18.6 billion.

But is it really just an automaker? I’d argue Xpeng is in fact a software company providing full-stack AI mobility solutions, and seems hugely underestimated by analysts and markets alike. Here’s why Xpeng could see large growth in the coming years, perhaps hitting US$100 by end-2026 (or \~US$100 billion market cap), using a simple SWOT analysis.

**STRENGTHS** 

1. **Product & Design:** Xpeng’s cars have always had aesthetics in mind, with their latest P7+ and sub-brand MONA M03 sedans’ stylish looks, best-in-class comfort, and large space now huge bestsellers in China. Xpeng is now the 3rd best selling EV carmaker in China at the moment, behind BYD, Wuling, and Geely.
2. **Affordability:** Xpeng cars are kept affordable while retaining many luxury and tech features, providing good value-for-money.
3. **Cutting-edge Technology & Features:** Outstanding Xpeng tech includes an in-house powertrain integrated with the vehicle chassis, plus outstanding autonomous driving capabilities and smart features.
4. **Strong Leadership Team:** In 2023, CEO Xiaopeng and President Wang Fengying overhauled the management team, rooted out corruption, eradicated departmental inefficiencies, and shifted to a more user-centric focus. The CEO remains humble and fully committed to building the company to reach greater heights.
5. **Strong Supply Chain, Marketing & Branding Management:** After a tumultuous 2022 and 2023, Xpeng’s product, marketing, and supply chain teams are now all working harmoniously to swiftly ramp up production and deliver blockbuster hits one after another.
6. **Financials:** The [CEO has recently hinted at a breakeven quarter this year](https://cnevpost.com/2025/02/07/xpeng-expects-break-even-single-quarter-2025/), which will be a pivotal turning point for the company and change in valuation metrics.

**WEAKNESSES**

1. **Low Brand Strength & Perception:** Xpeng is slowly but surely growing its reputation in China and overseas, with stronger sales.
2. **Intense Industry Competition & Price Wars Creating Margin Erosion:** Might not necessarily be a weakness since competition breeds innovation and efficiency (see Deepseek). Moreover, Xpeng has several cost advantages, such as Gigapresses and joint raw materials purchases with partner Volkswagen.

**OPPORTUNITIES** 

1. **Strong 2025 Pipeline:** 2025 official target deliveries is 380–400,000. However looking at their strong pipeline, especially for L3 autonomous driving, I am forecasting 450–500,000 deliveries for this year, with a possibility of attaining 800,000+ EV deliveries for 2026.
2. **Autonomous Driving (AD) & Self Driving Cars:** Xpeng is a strong contender for this race, with the CEO declaring in January 2025 they will achieve Quasi-L3 AD by mid-2025 and Full L3 AD by end of 2025.
3. **Flying Cars:** Xpeng’s Land Aircraft Carrier (modular van and flying eVTOL module) will start deliveries in 2026 (no, this is not a wild going-by-faith projection, the [factory is currently under construction with target completion in 3Q 2025](https://cnevpost.com/2024/10/27/xpeng-aeroht-flying-car-base-breaks-ground/)). Their entry will shake up the low-altitude economy due to its mass production capabilities, cost advantages, and synergies with EV production and technology. But don't expect this business to have a huge impact on the stock by itself.
4. **Humanoid Robots:** Xpeng’s bipedal, all-purpose Iron Robots have already been deployed in Xpeng’s factories and stores, and are expected to enter trial commercial use in the second half of 2025, meaning commercial use may come in 2026, including **talking and moving like humans.** Much potential in this enormous space for Xpeng, which has several differences in its robot tech from its peers (with the CEO just saying he is confident [Xpeng will deploy one of the earliest mass-produced L3 robots in China](https://m.weibo.cn/status/5137890441693096)).
5. **AI Car Chips:** Xpeng will mass-produce their potentially game-changing Turing AI chip in mid-2025 (3x the computing power of industry standard Nvidia's Drive Orin-X), where it will set off a chain motion of new product launches. Possible to be adopted by other automakers too. Angus McKenzie from Motortrend has speculated that if Xpeng’s Turing Chip lives up to its full potential, it could be a [Deepseek moment for the car industry](https://www.motortrend.com/news/xpeng-develops-ai-chip-deepseek-moment/). 
6. **Robocars & Robotaxis:** The final step in autonomous driving (L4/L5 AD), and with endless possibilities: From transportation to food delivery to mobile convenience stores to F&B to ecommerce deliveries. Coupled with Iron Robot can achieve wonders in any industry.
7. **Global Expansion:** Xpeng car sales are accelerating around the world, with a targeted presence in 60 countries by end of 2025, compared to 30 as of end 2024.
8. **Increasing Partnerships & Institutional Investors:** Existing partnerships and investments by Volkswagen may deepen, and institutional investors (domestic or foreign) may start to invest in Xpeng as it becomes recognized worldwide.

**THREATS** 

1. **Competition:** There is always intense **price competition** in the EV sector, whether in China or overseas. However, Xpeng is in a sweet spot of value for money and product, and will continue to attract customers in the entry-level range. **Competition in autonomous driving** is fierce, and there’s a chance another car company unlocks L3 and L4 before Xpeng. However, Xpeng will get there eventually too, and it has other prospects, plus it can always catch up and outshine with its robocar offerings. Some may also be worried that **copycats** will mimic Xpeng’s popular car models bolt for bolt, but it’s not so simple as Xpeng has built up a decade’s worth of proprietary innovation and expertise in building cutting-edge EVs. And will continue to do so.
2. **Loss of Innovation:** Xpeng depends heavily on its tech innovation to stand out. Loss of key men may cause a brain drain and loss of technological edge. Xpeng is tackling this by recruiting the best and brightest, and heavily invested in R&D.
3. **Geopolitical Tensions:** I believe a **major war is very unlikely** under the current Trump administration. But increasing friction between USA and China may spark another call for **delisting of China ADRs**, which if comes to pass will create volatility in the stock prices, but I feel Xpeng’s stock will eventually recover and push higher as the company performs well (will have small forex risk though). USA may also decide to **tighten EV chip restrictions** on China automakers, but that will not affect Xpeng as it transitions to its own Turing Chip for all its products in mid-2025 (may turn out to be a boon instead as competitors falter).
4. **Global or Domestic Economic Softness:** Any economic slowdown in China or the rest of the world will have a mixed effect on Xpeng’s position as an affordable, mass market, smart EV brand. A slowdown could actually spur more consumers to go for bang-for-their-buck cars, and Xpeng fits the bill perfectly.

**SUMMARY**

Do you want to own a company that can potentially change the world? Xpeng could turn out to be the **Tesla of China, Figure AI of China, Archer Aviation of China, Nvidia of Cars: All rolled into one!**

The risk reward looks tremendously positive. And the worst case I can see right now is the stock goes sideways due to inexplicable stagnation in its domestic and overseas EV car business, PLUS all its other exciting prospects — Autonomous Driving, Flying Cars, AI Chips, Robots, Robocars — fall flat.

BUT, in a good scenario (not necessarily the best case even), if one or two of Xpeng’s businesses blast off? A review of each and my estimated valuations (now and end-2026, with estimated annual sales):

1. **EV Cars (Semi-AD)** — Current (**L2 AD**, 300K annual sales): US$18 Billion | End 2026 (**L3 AD**, 800K-1M sales + huge/growing orderbook): US$50–60 Billion *(Benchmarked against BYD & Li Auto valuation)*
2. **Flying Cars** — Current (3K orderbook): US$1 Billion | End 2026 (10K sales + 10–30K orderbook, depends on type): US$5–20 Billion *(*[*Benchmarked against Archer Aviation valuation*](https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2024/Archer-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Demonstrating-Manufacturing-Certification-and-Commercial-Launch-Momentum/default.aspx)*)*
3. **Robots** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (5–10K sales + 10–100K orderbook): US$5–60 Billion *(Wildcard, Enormous potential,* [*Benchmarked against Figure AI valuation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/robotics-startup-figure-ai-in-talks-for-new-funding-at-39-5-billion-valuation)*)*
4. **AI Chips** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (0–20K orderbook + partnerships): US$2–20 Billion *(Big wildcard at the moment)*
5. **Robocars (Full-AD)** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (10–50K orderbook + partnerships): US$5–40 Billion *(Enormous potential,* [*Benchmarked against Waymo & Tesla valuation*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-waymo-stock-tesla-robotaxis-29a57e01) *with big haircut)*

Is this so ridiculous? Bear in mind Tesla’s sky high valuation for its future autonomous driving, robot, and robocar plays. Now Xpeng is valued at a mere 1.8% of Tesla. A major product breakthrough can trigger a sharp bull run for Xpeng, cause short-sellers to stay away, and maybe turn it into a meme stock. Just my 2 cents.

""Investments in distributed generation with solar photovoltaics (PV) present a promising opportunity to hedge against inflation, considering non-taxed profits from PV energy generation. To investigate that potential, this study quantifies the return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, net present cost, and levelized cost of energy of PV by running Solar Alone Multi-Objective Advisor (SAMA) simulations on grid-connected PV systems across different regions with varying inflation scenarios. The case studies are San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Santiago, Chile; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Historical inflation data are also imposed on San Diego to assess PV system potential in dynamic inflammatory conditions, while Boston and Santiago additionally analyze hybrid PV-battery systems to understand battery impacts under increasing inflation rates. Net metering credits vary by location. The results showed that PV could be used as an effective inflation hedge in any region where PV started economically and provided increasingly attractive returns as inflation increased, particularly when taxes were considered.""",0,,2025-02-25,0.6808,0.9661,0.5252533555030823,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.7521249999999999,0.3939400166273117,0.5730325083136558,78.65162541568279,very_positive

There’s been lots of talk recently about international investments, but for years now, VXUS and just buying the entire world market, minus the US, has been the only one that I’ve really heard about, and the returns have been so significantly less than US stocks and ETFs.

One concern I thought of is that VXUS holds 8000+ companies. Considering that the S&P 500 is mostly driven by just a few companies, I’d like to see how an etf that was compromised of just a few hundred non-us companies performed. Also, I was curious about other EX-US etfs that might have good returns in the future in general, even if the US has poor returns

So far I’ve found 3 ETFs found that have caught some of my interest: 

BKIE- mid to large cap developed markets EX-US etf with just under 1000 holdings. This sounds a lot like what I was looking.The index it tracks also has had decent returns historically.

IDMO-based on the S&P World Ex-U.S. Momentum Index. Apparently the holdings are rebalanced twice a year based on a momentum score. I’m not sure if this rebalancing will be considered a taxable event in my account, but this index/etf also has good returns. After further reading, it sounds like ETFs following momentum indexes may be bad to hold during bear markets though?

Country/Region specific ETFs such as DBEZ- hedged eurozone etf. I’m not sure how an etf like this would do if the US dollar fluctuates wildly since it’s hedged, but it’s a choice if I want to focus on the eurozone.

So, what would you go with if you wanted to buy and hold and get reasonable returns? An etf for a specific region like China, Europe, or Australia? A momentum etf? An index like the developed market large cap?

I suppose my reasoning for wanting to be involved in the sector was because I think it’s the energy of the future. 

A pellet of uranium, the size of a finger nail, can create the same amount of energy as 1 ton of coal, or 150 gallons of oil. (Roughly 1 MWh of electricity) 

The nuclear lifecycle creates minimal carbon emissions. And it’s 0 carbon emissions while actually producing the electricity. All of the carbon emissions come from mining, fuel processing, construction, and waste management. It’s on par with wind energy for lifecycle emissions without the drawback of being an intermittent form of energy. 

For some context here, nuclear energy produces 3-15 gCO2/kWh across the lifecycle while natural gas produces 400-500 gCO2/kWh. 

An unfortunate realization I’ve come to regarding the performance of nuclear energy stocks is that they’re heavily dependent on the performance of tech companies, specifically AI. Friday and today saw widespread declines across nuclear energy stocks because Microsoft noted less demand than they originally thought for new data centers.

I don't think I will get any statement showing my cost basis until next tax season, which will be too late to do anything to avoid a penalty.

If the markets high? I buy it. If there’s a dip? I buy even more.

S&P is great, and by being 50+% VOO and a mix of mag 7, I’ve had excellent returns since 2020. With that said, I’m a young investor (27m), and I’d like to plan more intelligently for the long term. 

What industries, or companies, do you all believe will be around and thriving 20-30+ years from now?

For me, I think the culture of “tech” companies will continue to be strong with their hyper efficiency, monopolistic power, and acquisitive nature. So amazon, google, meta and Microsoft, will continue to acquire competitors and dominate all aspects of American life for years to come imo, but there are also dominant monopoly-like players in Walmart and Costco which I also believe will continue to rise and do in the physical world what the tech giants can’t/won’t. In terms of “what we’ll always need” in food, water, shelter, I’m less familiar with players that have the same level of dominance and will last. 

I think energy is the crisis of our time, but I’m hesitant to bet on any individual company at this point. I’m not sure if others have insight, but I’d love to hear arguments not for what matters this year, but what will matter in the longest term.

Your company has restricted this trade for a Buy.  Talk to your administrator if you have questions (DO478)

1.  Caution. This buy order was accepted without sufficient settled funds to trade in your account.  If you subsequently sell this security without first delivering sufficient cash by settlement date, you may incur a trading restriction requiring settled cash up front for future purchase (AC176)



I really would just like some clarity from those who know much more than I do here.  The chat people are giving me conflicting info an I just want to know what I need to do to allow me to sell a position and purchase another on the same day.  Situation: I held 246 shares of a stock since \~1/30/24.  On 2/20/25 I deposited  \~$40K.  Today, I sold 246 shares and attempted to buy another ETF with those funds and I was greeted with a ""This buy order was accepted without sufficient settled funds to trade in your account"".

However, the person I spoke to initially said this which makes me feels there is no limit if I can reinvest:

>**If you wish to reinvest the funds, they are available immediately after the sell order**, fills. If you wish to withdraw the funds, you are required to wait a minimum of one business day

>**If you sell something that was paid for with settled funds, then the funds are available immediately**.

This leads me to believe the funds are available immediately (Based on my interpretation of what she said above) as I did buy these shares a month prior.

>So it looks like the buy order of the shares occurred today. This means, the buy order was not settled when you decided to sell and that is why the funds are not available immediately.

The reinvestment buy order was completed right **after** the sale of the stocks that had been in my portfolio for a month.

>A good faith trading violation occurs when you buy a stock or investment with unsettled funds and then sell those new shares before the proceeds funding its purchase have settled. In other words, you sell stock 1, to buy stock 2. There is no issue with this, but when you sell stock 2 before the settlement period has passed for selling stock 1, this becomes a good faith violation. This has restricted your available cash until the trades settle.

Then she contradicts her original statement.  She said there was NO settledfund for reinvestment above.  How can they be available immediately after a sell order if the below is also true?

>So the rules I discussed about funds being available immediately after the sell does not apply due to the good faith violation on the account currently.

Then this when asking a about selling the shares I've held for a month.:

>Those are settled yes but sales have their own settlement. All trades require one business day to settle.

Then this LOL

ME:  
Ok you said this before ""If the funds used to purchase the shares were settled at the time of the purchase, they are available immediately after the sale.

>CSR:  
This would be true if you had not received a ""Good Faith Violation"" which restricts your account to ""settled funds only.""

And again later, to confuse me even more as they clearly are NOT available for reinvestment due to this good faith violation which I still don't understand as I sold something I've held for over a month

>They are available for reinvestment but considered unsettled.

So I asked:  If they are available for reinvestment what activity did I do this morning that prevented them from being able to be reinvested??

And then she leaves it with this when I asked what I could do to prevent this:

>If you anticipate and trade with regards to the settlement time of one business day for all trades, you will be good to go.

So I can reinvest same day then I can't, then I can.  I was able to reinvest in the stock I had just sold once I realized I was unable to purchase the stock I had sold for.  Why would that not violate this good faith clause?

Thanks, and sorry for the long winded question.

The year was 2002. A good friend's cousin joined a startup called ""What's For Free Technologies"" (WFFT). They were developing a website that people would visit to received free promotional items. Behind the scenes, they were securing agreements with big names in retailing and polishing up the website, soon to be released. The stock was regularly trading between $6-$10 and would ride these predictable waves. I started trading on paper and, with an initial $1000 investment, had made tens of thousands of dollars buying low and selling high.

I got some valuable information 3rd hand from the cousin that worked there - the company seemed to have had great success in securing deals, they hired an extra 50 programmers/employees for the website and everyone had just started to relocate into a huge, swanky commercial space. Morale was at an all time high. The website launch was in 1 month. I convinced my wife that investing now was the best move. I sunk in $1000 real dollars (which, at the time, was every penny we had saved).

Cut to the website launch day and I take the day off work to monitor my investment! Given that the stock (currently sitting predictably at $6) would rise to $10 without fail BEFORE the website launch, I had decided not to be greedy and would sell above $10 the very moment it seemed that it might be peaking. I would not hold out of greed. I was going to cut and run. My gut told me it might hit $14-$15.

Site launches. Stock briefly rises to $7 then back to $6. A hour goes by with little movement. Confusing, why aren't people excited about the release? Stock makes another surge to $7 before slowly settling to $6. It slowly drops to $5 reverses back to $6. I'm checking every 5 minutes. I can't understand, the stock has never acted this way. I called my friend who tells me that his buddy and the WFFT workers are all excitedly buying stock from their offices. He assures me, don't worry, this thing is gonna skyrocket! I'm excited again.

I watched as the stock slowly slid to $4 over the next hour or so. I call my friend back. He says his cousin (who works for WFFT) says there is some disappointment over the quality of the website but not to worry, the deals and partnerships are amazing. He said the management group has left the facility, he assumes to drum up some business, reminding investors that the cosmetics of the site will be improved but the value is there. The employees have food and champagne on ice, waiting for the stock to jump. The air, he says, is electric.

I watch as the stock goes $4 to $3 to $2...to under a dollar in less than 10 minutes. I'm stunned. I don't believe it. I call my friend. His cousin is raging. They got an email from the management group saying everyone is being laid off until further notice. I lost my investment.

Post mortem: the owners of the company propped up the share price by selling a lie. They didn't have many good partnerships and the website design sucked. They sold all their shares at one of the peaks and the price tumbled as confidence was eroded. At the end of the day, the company didn't have a valuable service, they knew it for many many months as they hyped up and sold shares, ultimately cashing out and tanking the stock and shuttering the company. Even with a person on the inside, you can get burned. I've never speculated on a stock since.",0,,2025-02-24,-0.34,0.9965,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,-0.005874999999999991,0.0,-0.0029374999999999957,49.853125,neutral

Bitcoin has been popular for 15 years, but it still doesn’t seem to have a mainstream, everyday use. You can’t just walk into most stores and buy groceries or gas with it. Yet, every time it surges, people start calling it ""the future of finance,"" but that future never really happens.

I keep hearing about institutional money coming in, but if it’s mostly hedge funds and whales pushing the price up, how does that make it a real currency? If regular people are just there to provide liquidity for the big dogs, how is this different from a glorified pump-and-dump?

Don't get me wrong I'm a Bitcoin fan and have been buying and selling it for years now. But I cringe everytime I hear “It’s digital gold”.. Gold has a use beyond its speculative value. It can be made into jewelry, art.. People want to have it because its a ‘real’ thing you can hold in your hands! Bitcoin's only real use is making anonymous transactions that regular humans don't usually need to make.

Am I missing something here, or is Bitcoin actually just a bigger fool scheme?

Edit: When you ask the trading AI everyone on tiktok uses ([this one](http://trademind.ca))  It basically says Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi because there’s no central scammer, no guaranteed payouts, and it still functions even when prices crash.

I figure Vanguard has some more safety nets in place, but I question the skill set of their financial advisers since they have so many and I’m sure turnover is a problem there and I don’t know how particular they are in hiring people.

investing,Is 2x LETF (QLD/TQQQ) Functionally the Same as Using Margin? A Comparative Analysis,1iwy1ox,raylewinster,2025-02-24 04:19:58,3,0.62,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iwy1ox/is_2x_letf_qldtqqq_functionally_the_same_as_using/,"I've been analyzing leveraged ETFs (LETFs), particularly QLD (2x QQQ) and TQQQ (3x QQQ), to see how they compare with using margin to achieve the same leverage. My findings suggest that LETFs might perform nearly identically to margin investing—assuming competitive broker interest rates. However, I'm looking for feedback from the community to validate my approach.

# My Approach & Findings

1. **Simulating 2x Leverage on QQQ**
   * 100% **QLD**
   * Manually leveraged portfolio of **50% QQQ and 50% TQQQ**
   * Traditionally leveraged portfolio of 100% QQQ and another 100% QQQ that incurs daily interest
   * Initially, this approach suggested LETFs were slightly worse due to the drag from expense ratios.
   * However, when factoring in TQQQ (3x LETF) + QQQ (1x), the combined expense ratio actually outperformed a pure 2x margin strategy.
2. **Factoring in Interest Rate Costs for Margin**
   * To simulate traditional leverage, I incorporated the **federal funds rate** as a proxy for margin loan costs.
   * This wasn’t ideal because broker rates aren’t necessarily tied to the fed funds rate, so I added a **1% premium to better reflect real-world brokerage lending rates**.
   * With this adjustment, the **returns of margin investing and LETFs converged closely**.
3. **Key Takeaway: Competitive Margin Rates Make LETFs Less Appealing**
   * If a broker charges **1% above the fed funds rate**, leveraged investing with margin looks **almost identical** to LETFs in performance.
   * If the broker rate is **1.5%+ above the fed funds rate**, LETFs **become the better option** due to lower effective costs

[Traditional Leverage has similar returns to LETFs when competitive brokerage interest rate is used](https://preview.redd.it/9akjo4aaz1le1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=918976feffc51dcc6d7cdfe390b37697282f637a)



# Questions for the Community

1. **Is my methodology sound?** Am I missing any critical factors that would make LETFs behave differently from margin investing?
2. **How well does my margin cost assumption hold up?** What are realistic margin rates that retail traders actually get?
3. **Other risks I should consider?** I know LETFs have compounding decay, but in a strong uptrend, this isn’t as big of an issue.

Would love to get some feedback before I refine this further. Appreciate any critiques or suggestions!

Lets say Company A and Company B have a share price of $10, and for the sake of keeping this simple, and lets say premiums are $5 overall.  At a future date, you make a profit if:

* Company A went up and Company B went down.  For example, Company A went up to $15 and B went down to $5, you make $5.
* Company B went down and Company A went up.  For example, Company A went down to $8 and B went up $16, you make $1.



Now more complexly you make a profit if:

* Company A outperforms Company B and both went up.  For example, Company A went up to $25 and Company B went up $15, you would only make $5.
* Company B outperforms Company A and both went up.  For example, Company B up to $18 and Company A went up to $11, you would make $2.
* Company A stays flat and Company B went up.  For example, Company A stays at $10 and Company B went up to $20, you would make $5.



You lose money if they both move in tandem or do not move at all:

* Company A stays flat and Company B stay flat, meaning you lose your $5 premium.
* Company A rises a little and Company B drops a little.  For example, Company A goes up to $12 and Company B down to $9, you lose $2.
* Company A rises a lot and so does Company B the same amount.  For example, Company A goes up to $20 and Company B goes up to $20, you lose $5.
* Company A drops a lot and so does Company B the same amount.  For example, Company A goes up down to $2 and Company B down up to $3, you lose $4.

  
Now, what I know I can do is say if I think one will remain flat and the other one will either rise or lower, then I can take out a Long Butterfly Spread in one of the companies and a Short Butterfly Spread in the other, but what I cannot figure out is a way to do this symmetrically across both companies.

This is slightly possible to do if you already own shares in one company and you want to gain the amount of shares you have in that company.  You can sell your shares in a company and take out a Short Butterfly in the other company, then converting your profits back into the original company you sold, but this is not thinking in terms of cash.",0,,2025-02-24,0.7184,0.8568,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.7530000000000001,0.0,0.37650000000000006,68.825,positive

I’m comfortably saving £800-£1200 a month and have been placing it into premium bonds (£10,500 saved) currently, as a lot of banks with good interest rates require you to be 18.

I’ve had no luck with premium bonds really and I am looking to place my money elsewhere (investing!) 

FYI I turn 18 in 2 months, so I will be open to a lot more opportunities. 

Where should I start? Any and all advice is appreciated 🙏

Here's what he says and here are my questions..  

* IRL who actually BIDS.. who actually SELLS? 
* WHO DOES IT FIRST?? 
* we combine online methods and you have individual people, hedge funds banking society mutual funds etc etc who does what first how does the price actually change.. I don't get it...  

* take us for example we buy into VUSA OR VOO..  So... How does affect stock market.  ...

* how many trade actually cause the specific price to move lol... 


HERE'S GBT BASIC EXPLANATION 


You said:
Explain how bid and sell cause the market ticker to move
ChatGPT said:
The market ticker moves based on the interaction of bid and ask (sell) prices in an order book. Here’s how it works:

Bid Price (Buyers' Offers) – This is the highest price that buyers are currently willing to pay for an asset. If a seller agrees to sell at this price, a trade happens.

Ask Price (Sellers' Offers) – This is the lowest price that sellers are willing to accept for an asset. If a buyer is willing to pay this price, a trade occurs.

Price Movement:

If buyers are aggressive and start placing higher bid prices, the stock or asset price moves up.
If sellers are aggressive and start placing lower ask prices, the price moves down.
If a large market order (instant buy or sell) clears existing bid or ask levels, the price can move significantly in either direction.
Market Orders vs. Limit Orders:

Market orders execute at the best available price, pushing the price up (for buys) or down (for sells).
Limit orders sit in the order book until matched, influencing the spread between bid and ask but not moving the price immediately.
Example:
A stock's bid price is £100, and the ask price is £101.
A buyer places a market buy order for 10 shares.
If the lowest available ask price is £101, the trade happens at £101, moving the ticker up.
If a seller aggressively sells at £99, it can push the ticker down.
In summary, the market price moves based on supply (sell orders) and demand (buy orders), with large or aggressive trades having the most impact.

I’m not the most educated when it comes to investing but I’m trying to change that. I recently opened a UTMA through Schwab for my 1 year old and invested 11k. I also plan on contributing monthly a minimum of $80-$200 and investing it.

In effort to actually make this happen relatively quickly, the investing, I went to GPT a lot for guidance. I essentially prompted it to create a well rounded and balanced strategy that would enable the balance to grow over 100k by the time my child reaches 21. With the strategy it provided and assuming I stay the track with contributing, and of course the world doesn’t end/markets tank at the wrong time, this account should technically grow past 100k if not well over assuming the markets more or less follow the same trend over the next 20 years as I did the past 20.

I’d like feedback on the strategy it’s provided me. It made sense to me but I also never really invested any serious money in the market.

Additionally I went to simplywall.st and google finance to the PE and potential target price.

This is the result:

investing,Here is why stocks beat rentals,1ivbhvr,ContemplatingGavre,2025-02-22 00:25:40,520,0.86,470,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ivbhvr/here_is_why_stocks_beat_rentals/,"Today I was visiting the different rentals I have and while in the car did a lot of analyzing rentals versus stocks. Since the topic comes up frequently I will give my thoughts. 

Example rental I have. $40k purchase price, $750/mo rent. This is a great deal by all metrics. This is essentially a 2% rule deal which is unheard of.

Taxes $100/mo, insurance $100/mo, maintenance $100/mo, lawn care and miscellaneous $100/mo. Anyone who knows Realestate knows $100 a month doesn’t really cover major capex but let’s go with it. 

Net is essentially $350/mo or about $4k a year on $40k. 10% not bad. I can probably increase rent 5% a year, the property will increase 5% a year. and let’s say I hold for 30 years. 

After 30 years I made give or take $200k in rent and the property is worth $165k. And my annual rent will be about $18k now. 


$40k in BTI stock right now would pay you $3,200 a year in dividends. If you reinvest all dividends for 30y, they increase dividends 5% and the share appreciates 3%…

My shares are worth $234k, I made a total of $155k in dividends, I’m receiving $24k annually from dividends. 

A few things not taken into consideration include the ability to use leverage which can increase returns but also increase risk, alternatively the work required to maintain a rental. No management fees have been included as well. 

Now take all this into consideration, the likelihood or effort of finding a 2% deal, the work required, the liquidity of both, and the fact that I didn’t account for major capex and you can clearly see which is the better option.

Rather than sell off my VTI, I’d like to effectively “short” the US market. I would buy \~6-month puts, but I recently closed my options-approved account and transferred to a new brokerage. It’ll take me a bit to get approved for options.

So I’m looking for another way to “short” the US market. I’m not on margin and have never formally shorted a stock. Are there any good inverse ETFs that are effectively the same as shorting a stock? Any good recommendations on inverse VTI or SPY or anything that encompasses a large portion of the US market? 

Any insight on risks/negatives (high expense rates, impact on upside, etc.) would be much appreciated. I’m not looking to argue about where the market is headed as I shall not be moved!

Also Republicans (and Trump) are notorious De-regulators so I see companies eventually being mostly optimistic once we get out of this initial downturn.  Unfortunately, the Walmart’s of the world tend to temporarily drive market sentiment.  But I am not worried in the long-run once this initial period of bluster and uncertainty go away.

Because it's an ""inherited"" account, she can draw from it without paying penalties, but it is not a Roth so she will have to pay normal income tax on any withdrawals. She also cannot make any further contributions to the account. 

Now, we are rather low earners. Around $60k/yr together so we don't even fill the 12% tax bracket. I was considering pros and cons to slowly moving some of this account into a brokerage account, or a Roth IRA if possible. Looking at the long term capital gains tax brackets, it's unlikely we would pay much, if any, tax on withdrawals from the brokerage account during retirement since the the 0% long term capital gains tax bracket reaches nearly $100k when filling joint. 

If we did this, we would pay taxes now on whatever we move so there's less money to grow, but less taxes paid later (leaving us with slightly more money according to some quick estimated calculations). However, if we decided for any reason to change up allocations, there would be tax implications at that time. We keep most of our portfolio in the S&P 500 and have no plans to change that anytime soon, but it's worth considering. 

If we leave it as is and just let it grow, we pay nothing now, but full income tax rates in retirement. It also allows us to buy and sell within the account, if we decided to do so, without tax implications.

After analyzing various approaches and considering risk management, I'd like to share my refined investment strategy. This plan aims to balance leverage, growth potential, and portfolio stability over a 20+ year horizon.

Initial Portfolio Structure (200k€ Lumpsum)

* MIVU:FR (Amundi MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Factor UCITS): 35% (70k€) Core stability position providing lower volatility exposure to U.S. equities
* CL2:FR (Amundi 2x Leveraged MSCI USA UCITS ETF): 22.5% (45k€)
* LQQ:FR (Lyxor 2x Leveraged Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF): 22.5% (45k€) Combined 45% in 2x leveraged ETFs for enhanced market exposure
* PE500:FR (Amundi S&P 500 UCITS ETF): 10% (20k€)
* PANX:FR (Amundi Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF): 10% (20k€) Traditional ETFs for additional stability

Monthly Investment Plan & Leverage Strategy Starting with an initial portfolio leverage of 1.45x ((90k€ × 2 + 110k€) / 200k€), I'll be investing 1,500€/month exclusively into leveraged ETFs (split 50/50 between CL2 and LQQ). Through these monthly contributions, I aim to reach a target leverage of 1.6x in approximately 93 months (7.75 years). This approach relies entirely on fresh capital without selling any existing positions.

After the 93 months, I will exclusively invest in low-volatility S&P 500 or MSCI USA, depending on what is available at the time. If, by then, I have access to a 2x leveraged low-volatility ETF for the USA or even the world, I will allocate all my investments to that option.

Risk Management & Long-Term Approach The strategy maintains Min Vol as a permanent core (35%) to provide portfolio stability and reduce sequence risk. This, combined with the 20% allocation to non-leveraged ETFs, creates a strong foundation while still allowing for enhanced returns through leveraged exposure. The gradual increase in leverage through monthly contributions, rather than immediate reallocation, helps manage risk and reduce timing pressure.

Key Strategy Components:

* Initial leverage: 1.45x
* Target leverage: 1.6x (reached through monthly contributions)
* Timeline: \~93 months to reach target leverage
* Min Vol permanent allocation: 35%
* No selling of existing positions
* Pure contribution strategy: 1,500€/month to leveraged ETFs

Would love to hear your thoughts on this approach, particularly regarding:

1. The timeline to reach 1.6x leverage
2. The decision to maintain permanent Min Vol exposure
3. The monthly contribution strategy versus more aggressive reallocation

47 yoa - moved during the start of the last housing bubble so locked in 30 yr fixed 4.5 with 0.25% discount… essentially 4.25%.   Pay Off at 73 years of age.   Want to retire around 55.   

Parents want to give us $400,000 (200 each) to do with what we want.   I kidda don’t want to pay a mortgage until I’m 77 years old when I’m retiring at 55.   The 400,000 would be half of our current mortgage.  

I already have a 403b, and 457 that i was funding with hopes to use its tax free growth to pay off some mortgage when we retire.  Maxing Roth IRA for the last 15 years as well.

Would you:
1.  Make one big lump sum payment on house now and have the house paid off in 11 years (in time for retirement) 
2.  Buy government 10 year at 4.6%
3.  Invest in something with dividend
4.  Take 2 or 3 and use the divided or extra money paid to pay down mortgage as you go (should help pay 3 months per year at 4.5%)
5.  Other ideas?

Update:
Already have 1 year emergency fund and no debt other than mortgage… 4 kids who will most likely go to college but 529’s are funded pretty well for all 4.   I’m not sure why people downvoted my lack of risk tolerance for this money… very odd but ok.    Not sure if this changes things or people’s opinions but i did not think about the tax consequences of the 400 k.   

Option 6:   Due to taxes, i like the idea of a trust that someone suggested… maybe the 400k stays with my parents, they put it into a trust that pays out 18k to us per year and we just take the 18 k and put it to the mortgage.   The trust would have to make 4.5% to pay indefinitely, more to grow….  Interesting idea… thank you dude ",0,,2025-02-21,0.0,0.981,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.25,0.24525,0.0,0.122625,56.13125,positive

Well, we had quite a good run up to yesterday so I'll make a cut there since the vast majority of the stocks fell. This was not scientific at all, it's an average of 16 transactions per each name and I just bought everything they like and sold if they said so.

The names are just the first random stuff I could gather on investing subreddits.

Paul Thomas Investing - down 7.5 %. These are usually just stocks in freefall, I reckon they down 75% when I glance back but I had a 7% stop loss so they stopped at 7.5 haha

WallStreetZen - down 3.75 %

Zacks Ultimate (was on trial for cheap) - down 2.36 %  
Just gathering info from the articles rather than following investors seems to net much better results and is slightly in the plus.

AfterHour - down 2.07 %. Would be down way more if I didn't choose and pick hard what people and advice to follow. Got a 25% win with PLTR (smth I actually bought with real money), so I guess that's something.

Prospero ai - down 1.64 %

My weekly stock - down 1.30 %

Seeking alpha - down 0.43 % - almost not losing money at this point, impressive!  


Next step, testing in a bear market. I mean, I'm not gonna do it, but I have a feeling it does not look pretty.

But I’ve got a wild theory I’m chewing on, and I want your take. The tea leaves (X posts, earnings vibes, random chatter) suggest the board’s pumping the stock hard—like, artificially keeping it sky-high—to set up a sweet exit window for insiders and employees. Then, bam, they let it drop once the selling’s done.Here’s the kicker: Karp’s unloading 9.975M shares through Sept 2025 (SEC filings), and the next trading window’s mid-Feb to mid-April after earnings. Stock’s got hype, but this valuation’s a house of cards—feels like they’re nudging folks to cash out now before gravity hits. I’m calling it: if they ease off the juice post-window, PLTR could crater to $20 by March 2025. That’s, what, 20x forward earnings, closer to sanity for a software play, even with their AI glow.Am I nuts? Sell with the insiders in Feb-April while it’s $100+, or is this just FUD and PLTR holds the line? Could it really hit $20 that fast if the board stops propping it up?

Looks like my HSA has not been reinvesting dividends from me being in VTI but has been from Fidelity Government Cash Reserves, which I assume is my cash fund in the account. 

This is from an account that is years old so these contributions were from a while back and my contributions for this year are completed already. I am fine to simply buy more VTI with the dividends that have built up in my cash account at this time and then change my preferences in the future so that VTI does self reinvest, correct? No issues buying more stock with that money if I already bought my yearly allowance, since the I'm not trying to deposit additional money and instead moving money around within the HSA itself, right?

So many times I hear how risky they are, which i do agree, they are. 

But what I dont understand is that if one wants to short a particular stock what is the big deal if they sell a naked call option and collect a premium while doing so?


For example. 

If i want to sell a naked call option on NVDA at say 100 expiring next week and collect a premium of $500 while doing so and the stock jumps to $115 and i am assigned. Well now I'm assigned at $100 a share along with $500 in premium i collected, so in reality my cost basis if I include the $500 is $105 but it's now trading at 115. So I'm down a $1000

Now if i hold onto that short and wait it out because I'm still believing it's going to drop and it does drop it's a win win....

What am I missing...
