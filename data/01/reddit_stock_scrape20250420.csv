Actually Happened? April 9, 2025, U.S. government informed Nvidia exports H20 chips (and chip matching bandwidth capabilities) China, Hong Kong, Macau, D:5 countries require license. April 14, Nvidia told licensing requirement would remain effect “for indefinite future.” “The USG indicated license requirement addresses risk covered products may used in, diverted to, supercomputer China.” 2. $5.5B Isn’t Cash Burn—It’s Write-Down Nvidia announced Q1 FY2026 earnings (ending April 27) include “up approximately $5.5 billion charges associated H20 products”—covering inventory, purchase commitments, related reserves. accounting adjustment, hemorrhage cash. licenses granted chips reallocated, parts may recoverable. “Charges associated H20 products inventory, purchase commitments, related reserves.” 3. Total Ban = Total Collapse isn’t embargo. It’s regulatory bottleneck. chips can’t exported licenses granted. real unknown long delay lasts—or China get permanently locked out. Nvidia hasn’t banned selling globally. 4. 6% Drop May Overkill Wall Street shaved ~$140B Nvidia’s market cap forward-looking risk, operational miss. charge front-loaded. doesn’t mean $5.5B vanishes every quarter. kind drop makes sense believe: • Nvidia never gets licenses • China sales permanently dead • H20 inventory entirely unsellable None confirmed. 5. Goes Watch for: • updates U.S. Commerce Department export licenses • Nvidia’s pivot: re-bin, re-market, repurpose H20s? • China’s AI trajectory: accelerate local GPU production (Huawei, etc.)? TL;DR Nvidia didn’t lose $5.5B cash. U.S. imposed licensing requirement certain chips, forcing Nvidia adjust value inventory hand. chips aren’t bricked—they’re paused. 6% drop might market overreaction, sign long-term structural damage.

Anyone tells ""treasury attack"" braindead, hedge funds told lay basis trades might actually contributing volatility. Anyways, personal thesis treasury yields going simple: **The market pricing Trump actually serious implementing agenda.** Let's look facts; - Trump infinitely doubled tariff shit point. staffed administrative branch legislative branch true believers. amassed extreme amount economic foreign policy power hands alone, zero oversight. **If wanted actually press forward, much could.** - genuinely admires McKinley. actually bad thing, actually pretty decent president. issue fucking LARPing following tariff playbook 1:1, economic situations completely different. Back then, tariffs actually sorta worked wanted do. therein lies issue; **Trump might actually think right thing.** Nothing dangerous idealist think right. - Going back yields second, US totally unsustainable fiscal path.

Good luck selling US public this. - **The administration jam packed questionably sane ideologues.** mean, Navarro, really? living personification ""Source? came dream."" Holy shit man. - **The US government suffered one worst brain-drains modern institution ever last 3 months.** think want excessive government, going like joke. gonna stop here, get gist it. current projected policy paths genuinely insane get it. permabull train raw inertia; Canadian investing USD levered ETFs last 8 years genuinely changed trajectory life. So, what's next? fuck knows lmao, guessing **Euro**. fulfills main conditions reserve currency: **Capability run deficit responsibly, political stability, capable institutions, depth market/bond market, currency controls**. seeing recently, huge shift EUR-denominated assets face questionable sanity US side. personally seen enough, willing bet tariff man actually going shit. EDIT: Someone posed good question EU ""trade deficit"" comments. Here's response; EU actually run trade deficit 2008, point things started really breaking ready worth shit real crisis. hard pivoted exports band-aid economy without spending like crazy Germans hard-on austerity till 2012. recently still pushed hard it, starting see shackles come release debt brake NextGen bonds. That's extraordinarily bullish local consumption demand. actually argue NextGen bonds one bullish developments history EU, finally risk-shared supranational bond EU fiscal objectives. That's one part greater Union fiscal independence; contribution-driven meme ""state"" anymore. think exactly primary strategy export-focused basically path forward think gonna least try pivot domestic consumption economy like USA. Practically speaking, there's shot EU exports ever able compete China's long enough period time, pretty much everyone see that. There's shot US competes China's insanely focused industrial policy either, US obviously domestic economy running (sort of) perfectly. What's changing calculus really US policy gone ""basically flawless"" ""basically incoherent"". Genuinely starting global trade war way headwind anything else list is. Energy prices fixed stronger Euro (potentially) cratered global economy. Population pressures fixed high-quality immigration driven greater personal consumption standard living. significant benefits resource-poor nation like EU push become reserve currency; makes imports cheap hell proportionally, dramatically centralizes fiscal power EU's hands. think situation nearly fucked historically. need totally supplant USD, need present stable alternative actually drive growth, already pretty successful at; USD.EUR yield spreads German US bonds generationally positive EU's favor last weeks. **TLDR: made pretty retarded argument rest OP, near term think combination gutting global trade, running insane deficits 'good' economy committing extreme tax cuts, implementing extremely regressive taxation, massive cuts social security monumentally stupid recipe think America's systemic advantages anywhere near enough overcome headwinds, lead severe crisis confidence shit actually comes pass.**",0,

Historically, entering bear market often led declines. Yet, recent trends suggest isn’t always case. March 2020, swift Fed rate cuts quantitative easing propelled U.S. markets new highs almost immediately. Another example December 20, 2018, Nasdaq 100 dropped 20% peak, entering bear market, rebound quickly Fed Chair Powell hinted pausing rate hikes. instances show sensitive markets policy interventions, sometimes defying expectations rapid recoveries.

Apple, example, ramped buybacks starting 2018, spending $100 billion annually boosting stock price, pushing market cap past $1 trillion year.

Monday’s announcement going doozy, I’m calling now: we’re staring potential disaster semiconductor industry, textbook bull trap, seriously shady insider trading vibes. Let’s start Friday bombshell. April 11, 2025, **Trump administration** dropped *memo* Wall Street cartwheels: semiconductors, smartphones, laptops, bunch electronics exempted massive “reciprocal” tariffs Trump slapped China (we’re talking 125% levies—insane). U.S. Customs Border Protection bulletin listed **20 product categories, including memory chips, disc drives, flat panel displays, getting free pass.** Tech stocks like Apple, Dell, NVIDIA went nuts. S&P 500 already 10% since Trump took office, felt like lifeline. Futures soared, X buzzing “bull market confirmed” takes, everyone thought headed recovery rally. mean, wouldn’t bullish? looked like Trump giving Big Tech massive break. then, Sunday morning hits, **Howard Lutnick** goes ABC’s Week basically says, **“Psych!”** clarified exemptions? Yeah, they’re *temporary.* Semiconductors electronics still getting hit **“sector-specific”** tariffs **“a month two,”** tied national security Section 232 Trade Expansion Act. aren’t negotiable, unlike reciprocal tariffs. Lutnick’s exact words: “These things national security, need made America.” Suddenly, whole narrative flips. Friday exemption wasn’t win—it head fake. now, Monday’s announcement looming, Trump’s expected double semiconductor tariffs, potentially spelling chaos industry. Let’s talk big deal semiconductors. global chip supply chain insanely complex. semiconductors designed U.S., fabricated Taiwan (TSMC, anyone?), assembled finished places like China. Trump slaps tariffs chips coming China—or worse, starts national security probe messes whole supply chain—prices going spike. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm going take hit, mention downstream players like Apple, assemble iPhones China. Lutnick’s pushing “re-shore America” narrative, building chip fabs U.S. takes years billions dollars. TSMC’s Arizona plant isn’t even fully online yet! meantime, costs go up, supply chains choke, consumers get stuck pricier gadgets—or straight-up shortages. Now, let’s get bull trap. Friday’s exemption announcement like **catnip traders.** Everyone piled tech stocks, thinking tariff threat gone. Lutnick’s Sunday comments yanked rug out. Posts X already screaming it: “Yesterday’s exemptions weren’t surrender—they setup,” one user said. Another called “headline-driven market” administration “steering price action.” Monday’s announcement confirms heavy tariffs, bullish bets Friday going get crushed. could see brutal sell-off semiconductor stocks, dragging Nasdaq S&P 500 it. market’s already mess—wildest swings since COVID, 10% since January 20. could trap catches dip-buyers guard. here’s gets really ugly: insider trading market manipulation angle. Let’s rewind April 9, Trump posted Truth Social, **“THIS GREAT TIME BUY!!! DJT,”** hours announced 90-day tariff pause countries (except China). S&P 500 surged 9%, Nasdaq jumped 12.2%, Trump Media’s stock shot 22%. Coincidence? Democrats like Adam Schiff Maxine Waters aren’t buying it. They’re calling SEC investigations, saying Trump’s post reeks insider trading. Schiff’s letter White House asked knew tariff pause beforehand whether anyone traded it. Trump asked decided pause, cagey: “Over last days… probably came together early morning.” Yeah, right. Fast forward weekend’s semiconductor flip-flop, it’s déjà vu.

Believe me, it’s exciting action story, covering fall Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, face-punching. you’ll learn people know worried. **TL;DR**: Bond yields aren’t number — they’re signal trust. 10-year treasury starts rising market crash, it’s good sign. means world losing faith U.S. Here’s that’s dangerous, says leadership, macroeconomic pressure new frontline geopolitical power. ## **Trade Wars Tariffs, or, *How Learned Start Worrying Watch Bonds*** past two weeks, equity markets plummeted response Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. However, middle last week, 10-year treasury yield began rise sharply overnight. know started worry- lot. following day, Trump significantly revised tariff policy, citing bond market “queasiness."" brief primer designed help ordinary folks understand basics gain macroeconomic literacy necessary grasp times, may happening, concerning. ## **What Treasury Bond?** Imagine U.S. government borrows money people 10 years promises pay back little extra (interest). “little extra” called yield. treasury essentially that. It’s instrument government borrows money agrees pay back certain period time. 10-year treasury loan government repay 10 years bit more. Let’s say buy treasury $10 receive $11 back government 10 years. That’s 10% return lifespan, 0.96% annually compounded, approximately 1% per year simplified. refer 1% yield. selling bonds cause prices decrease? simple: supply demand, selling stocks lowers prices. suddenly sell large quantity anything, price drops supply exceeds demand. let’s say sell bond $8 someone dumping bonds prices falling. bond still pays $11 life. person buys getting $3 gain $8 investment — 37.5% total return 10 years. translates 3.2% annual return (compounded) — big jump original 1% yield! see, bond prices go down, yields go — move inversely. worth emphasizing: U.S. always repays amount ($11) regardless much someone later buys bond secondary market ($8). - bond sells $12 later, U.S. pays back $11. - bond sells $10 later, U.S. pays $11. - bond sells $8 later, U.S. pays $11. reason yield changes due U.S. repays, secondary market buyer paid different amount return. Making back $11 $12, $10, $8 investment results different profits, thus different yields. would someone sell bond $8 loss guaranteed eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)? need $8 want wait 10 years bond mature! might think get better 3.2% return investing money elsewhere. makes sense withdraw money bank account, even guaranteed earn 2% interest, need pay rent believe better 2% YOLO-ing 0-day TSLA puts. ## **Why Care 10-Year Treasury?** Remember example sold bond $8, caused yield rise 3.2%? Now, government needs borrow money again, can’t offer previous 1% yield. Why? people simply buy 3.2% yielding bond open market. stay competitive, government must raise interest rate new bonds satisfy market demands. result, ends paying borrow money. Think way: Imagine you’re builder town called Springville. years, you’ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses $100,000. However, Springville evolved. family-oriented town, everyone wants two bathrooms. one-bathroom homes previously built selling $50,000 resale market, buyers realize need spend additional $50,000 add second bathroom. Here’s issue: can’t continue building one-bathroom houses expect sell $100,000. Buyers won’t interested. would they, market values one-bathroom home $50,000? want maintain $100,000 price tag, you’ll need provide value, including second bathroom beginning. applies U.S. Treasury. wishes keep issuing debt, match market currently provides. Otherwise, investors simply look elsewhere. might say: Well, what? don’t care government pays interest. problem! *Oh, very, much problem.* 10-year treasury yield benchmark. Many loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, business loans) key it. yield goes up, means U.S. government pay borrow — you. Higher yields = higher interest rates across board. That’s bad for: - **Homebuyers** – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments - **Businesses** – higher borrowing costs = harder invest, hire, expand - **The government** – federal budget goes toward interest payments instead programs like schools infrastructure - **The stock market** – investors shift money stocks safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices Basically, many interest rates tied 10-year treasury yield, increase yield raises cost capital entire economy. Getting money becomes expensive. Business slows down. time, stock prices drop. It’s double whammy. That’s people watch health treasury market closely — impacts nearly everything economy, even don’t single bond yourself. ## **Why 10-Year treasury important benchmark?** want say “just because” — wouldn’t satisfy you. It’s 10-year treasury must benchmark, it’s one everyone watches hits sweet spot. Treasuries (so far) considered “risk-free.” They’re backed U.S. government super liquid. liquidity low risk provide market ton real-time data inflation expectations overall cost capital. they’re natural baseline figuring riskier borrowing cost. Imagine friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good money. Everyone willing loan money 2%. borrows lot, there’s plenty data rate people charge — confident 2% right baseline. Sam Suspicious comes along wants borrow. don’t know exactly charge him, since know Randy pays, simply add risk premium that. That’s market treats borrowers — builds known “risk-free” rate. 10-year treasury specifically? It’s short (like 2-year) long (like 30-year). captures market expectations inflation, economic growth, Fed policy medium-to-long horizon, making go-to reference point many long-term loans. Many countries 10-year bond benchmarks, Randy Reliable, U.S. 10-year treasury, remains gold standard globally. Europe, euro-denominated contracts don’t key U.S. treasury. Instead, German 10-year Bund de facto benchmark; it’s seen stable liquid bond Eurozone. examples include: - UK 10-year Gilt – common benchmark domestic British rates. - Japanese 10-year – used domestically, though heavily influenced BOJ policy. - Chinese 10-year – also exists, tends policy-driven less market-transparent. bonds exist useful, reliability global relevance vary, especially markets perceive government unstable, opaque, overly interventionist. US 10-year beats checks boxes: - Deep liquidity - Transparent, market-based pricing - Long track record stability - Dollar dominance — many contracts worldwide USD-denominated - Safe-haven status global crises benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka U.S. 10Y) remains handsome, well-dressed guy good credit score. benchmark another country suddenly something wild (Brexit, example), get burned. That’s predictability essential — investors need confidence, surprises. ## **So It’s Good Randy Reliable?** Yes, indeed good Randy Reliable. dollar’s position global reserve currency grants U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking U.S. actions tend backfire economies, making economic retaliation U.S. risky costly. Additionally, high global demand U.S. dollars keeps dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans purchase foreign goods affordably. However, there’s downside: strong dollar also makes American exports expensive, hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad. That’s undermining dollar's status reserve currency unspoken (but nearly essential) goal Trump's agenda, even fully aware it. Yet, it’s perilous strategy significantly weakens U.S. good article discussing found here: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar. ## **It Comes Trust Predictability?** you’re getting it. yield 10-year seen key indicator trust U.S. economy macroeconomic leadership. old Randy Reliable develops ketamine habit begins threatening friends? Well, suddenly doesn’t seem like safe person lend to. “long part curve” treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) often seen indicator financial health United States economy. Randy Reliable Randy Reckless? That’s question world asking right now, reflects yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure China countries top that, problem. I’ll get bit. ## **The Yield Entire Field** So, putting together, 10-year yield key barometer health strength U.S. economy trust American economic leadership. trust erodes, folks see U.S. riskier borrower. rates they’re comfortable charging loan money U.S. go up. Typically, periods financial uncertainty, yield 10-year treasuries goes DOWN. That’s long treasuries – lending Randy Reliable – always regarded safe haven. Remember, represents risk-free rate! equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift money safe place. buyers lead increase value treasuries. value yield inversely related, 10-year yield declines. that’s saw last week! Instead, stock prices falling, 10-year yield increasing. was… weird. markets longer saw treasuries safe haven. That’s scary thought. implied market losing faith United States concluding actually Randy Reckless. ## **Wasn’t Supposed Worried Inverted Yield Curve?** Aren’t higher long-term bond yields good thing? may heard inverted yield curve worrisome sign. That’s long-term bonds lower yield short-term bonds. situation also anomalous would expect longer-term loans higher risk. time means greater opportunity lender default inflation wreck you. higher risk typically leads higher rate long-term bonds compared short-term bonds. inverted yield curve signal. historically signals recession worth monitoring. Remember, equities investments decline, expect people seek safety – like Randy Reliable – leading drop 10-year yields. Therefore, inverted yield curve concerning, it’s still NORMAL. remains signal, systemic risk itself. Rising 10-year yields market weakness present different type danger: strategic selling foreign holders decline confidence U.S. creditworthiness. That’s recession signal. disease. That’s sovereign confidence event. Different animal. Nastier teeth. ## **What China, Japan, Canada This?** Now, China almost $800 billion treasuries (and also big buyer, creates demand). Japan holds even — $1 trillion. Canada also sizeable holding. move markets. remember, even China holds small fraction total outstanding treasuries, matters float — is, much bought sold given time. example, suppose typically 1% houses city sale time. Now, real estate mogul decides sell houses, make 2% housing stock. That’s small fraction homes city, triples supply sale. aren’t enough buyers that. So, prices drop. lot. Even though it’s 2% change total inventory, it’s huge disruption normal market activity. Japan, China, Canada impact treasury market similar way. sell lot once, particularly others selling treasuries too, simply won’t enough buyers cash ready, that’s refer liquidity crunch low-liquidity situation. Since China major buyer treasuries, also influence demand side halting purchases. ## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers** Conversely, increase 10-year yield last week may resulted major sovereign bondholders striking United States right hurts. engage macroeconomic Bond Market Chess Trump United States play Tariff Checkers. China, Japan, Canada wouldn’t even need crash market — sell slowly steadily, nudging long end yield curve upward time. matches witnessing now. alone quietly erode U.S. economy. Think boiling frog. Chinese take capital released treasury sales reinvest domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, innovation — effectively blunting impact trade war. So, they’re hitting brakes us stepping gas home. China smart enough know this, tools it. Canada Japan. Indeed, current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, one smartest macroeconomic thinkers there. dollar’s status global reserve currency gives U.S. immense advantages. there’s thing free lunch, kind yield exposure price pay privilege. saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.” U.S. strong, stable, globally engaged, financial pool deep even China countries make splash. start pulling back global economy, undermining institutions, projecting unreliability, that’s macroeconomic knives come actually hurt us... lot. particularly true we, belligerent economic policies, encourage Western Western-aligned countries collaborate American interests. exactly people like warning Trump’s policies misguided also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power. ## **Can’t Fed Something?** Yes no, really. Yes, Fed step buy long-term treasuries — that’s previous rounds Quantitative Easing (QE). there’s catch: it’s much harder Fed control long end yield curve (10- 30-year bonds) markets massive heavily influenced investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, fiscal credibility. Fed buys bonds, lower yields. However, aggressively long end could send dangerous signal: Fed suppressing risk manner markets may deem sustainable. underlying issue fiscal credibility, QE backfire — driving inflation fears ultimately causing long-term yields rise instead fall. yes, Fed intervene, risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening dollar, undermining confidence treasury markets. ## **So Make Chinese-Held Bonds Null Void?** reading primer, many suggested, don’t declare Chinese-held treasuries null void? power take leverage them! No, power. want crash entire bond market cause US default national debt? that’s it. would economic catastrophe highest order would make Great Depression look like mere blip. It’s someone spreading rumors violent tendencies. So, retaliation, publicly punch face. Voiding China’s notes makes much sense. simply proves exactly market unsure about. example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, Mary loan $10,000. decide hate Peter tell I’m paying back loan won’t repay sells anyone else. Peter’s loan becomes worthless. situation called default. Charlie, Joan, Mary realize could easily default loans well. So, panic sell loans quickly don’t trust me. value notes drops zero close nobody trusts pay back. Now, go market ask loans. Nobody wants lend money except extortionate rates. ## **What Do?** Ultimately, fixing require great deal time rebuilding trust. Unfortunately, trust something Fed print thin air, President United States enact Executive Order. Trust comes relationships time. There’s old adage: Trust takes decades build, moment lose, forever regain. witnessing real time. Restoring trust may well take decades now. easy fix.

Now, here’s things get even interesting. Analyst upgrades pouring Archer, Cantor Fitzgerald raising price target $13.00, $10.00, issuing """"overweight"""" rating.

Xiangyuan Culture Tourism signed contract 200 aircraft one time scenic area operation, sightseeing projects multiple cities generated stable cash flow. **The production capacity layout reveals ambition**: visited Yunfu base spot, debugging progress automated assembly line one month faster expected. production capacity 1,000 aircraft realized 2025, regional coverage Hefei/Weihai bases, EHang fully capable increasing delivery volume 3,000 aircraft within 2 years, 3 times current market consensus. II. **Financial Verification**: Think Profit Inflection Point Arrived? Facing financial report data, market always torn ""GAAP loss"", model shows non-GAAP profit real signal: **Revenue Explosion**: eVTOL Transformed ""PPT"" ""Money Printer"" company's revenue 456 million yuan 2024, Q4 accounted 36% (164 million yuan), verifying effect production capacity ramping up. According current delivery rhythm, estimate revenue Q1 2025 exceed 200 million yuan (a month-on-month increase 22%). annual guidance 900 million yuan conservative side. OC certificate approved scheduled, shows revenue operation services feasible. Assuming annual revenue per aircraft 2 million yuan, cover 3,000 scenic areas (5 aircraft per scenic area), potential scale operation revenue 30 billion yuan, open second growth curve. 2. **The Mystery Gross Profit Margin**: Short-term Pain, Long-term Brightness Many people worried decline gross profit margin 64.1% 61.4%, disassembled cost structure, found one-time investment airworthiness modification EH216-S pushed unit cost, factor eliminated Q2 2025. importantly, gross profit margin operation services high 75% (only 58% hardware). proportion service revenue increases 5% 20%, overall gross profit margin may return 65% end 2025. 3. **Cash Generation Ability**: Underestimated Survival Chip EHang's operating cash flow positive 5 consecutive quarters, cash hand 1.155 billion yuan sufficient cover 3 years R&D investment. Compared Joby Aviation, burns money astonishing speed (an annual loss $400 million), EHang's ""self-cash generation"" ability makes think highly risk resistance. III. **Valuation Divergence**: Exactly Market Wrong? Currently, EHang's market value corresponds PS 15 times 2025, peer Joby high 69 times. huge disparity puzzled discovered two major cognitive differences: 1.**The Market Underestimates China's Policy Execution Ability** Overseas investors difficulty understanding promotion speed ""Chinese low-altitude economy"". Shenzhen built world's first city-level low-altitude dispatching system, Hefei plans lay 500 takeoff landing points 2025. implementation infrastructure projects directly increase utilization rate eVTOL, counterparts Europe United States still arguing FAA regulatory framework. 2.**The Revenue Operation Services Priced** current valuation reflects hardware sales, EHang piloting ""profit-sharing model"" scenic areas Dabie Mountains (a 30% commission flight revenue). model works, proportion operation revenue exceed 20% 2025, valuation system shift SaaS company (8-10 times PS), means least 50% room correction. IV. **Risk Warnings**: Three Major Risk Points Closely Track Although optimistic long term, shy away risks. following variables may subvert logic: 1.**The Mass Production Solid-state Batteries Delayed**: technical route Hefei Research Institute tested winter low temperatures. cannot mass-produced Q3 2025, endurance advantage diluted. 2.**Local Government Debt Drags Infrastructure Construction**: construction low-altitude takeoff landing points depends government investment. fiscal policy tightened, may lead lower-than-expected implementation scenarios. 3.**Intensified Competition**: entry international competitors Joby (PS 69 times) domestic competitors XPeng Aeroht (with pre-sales exceeding 3,000 aircraft) may squeeze market share affect valuation premium. **Conclusion**: Positioning Strategy Key Nodes analyst heavy position EHang, operation logic clear: **In short term**: approval OC certificate (Q1 2025) delivery volume Q1 (target 200 aircraft) catalysts stock price. stock price falls 20-day moving average, reduce position periodically. **In long term**: Hold end 2025. target price corresponds PS 8 times 2026 (revenue 2 billion yuan), expected upside 120%. **Finally, reminder**: eVTOL short-term speculation concept, one needs endure fluctuations policy technological iteration. believe urban sky eventually reshaped, EHang may sharpest spear next decade.",0,
